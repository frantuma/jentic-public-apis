You can type several terms separated by spaces or phrases wrapped inside quote \u2018\u201d\u2019 characters. For every term, you can also use \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018-\u2018 modifier characters to indicate that a term is \u201cmandatory\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d (by default, terms are considered to be \u201cmandatory\u201d). For example, in a query such as query=term_a -term_b, sounds including term_b will not match the search criteria. The query does a weighted search over some sound properties including sound tags, the sound name, its description, pack name and the sound id. Therefore, searching for query=123 will find you sounds with id 1234, sounds that have 1234 in the description, in the tags, etc. You\u2019ll find some examples below.
