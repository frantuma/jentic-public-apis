Various cases include: - If `low` = `high`, the viewport consists of that single point. - If `low.longitude` > `high.longitude`, the longitude range is inverted (the viewport crosses the 180 degree longitude line). - If `low.longitude` = -180 degrees and `high.longitude` = 180 degrees, the viewport includes all longitudes. - If `low.longitude` = 180 degrees and `high.longitude` = -180 degrees, the longitude range is empty. - If `low.latitude` > `high.latitude`, the latitude range is empty. Both `low` and `high` must be populated, and the represented box cannot be empty (as specified by the definitions above). An empty viewport will result in an error.

In typical usage, an address would be created by user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input or editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput. - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used.

Because values in `address_lines` do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (for example, \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country or region of the address. In places where this can vary (for example, Japan), `address_language` is used to make it explicit (for example, \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). In this way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a `region_code` with all remaining information placed in the `address_lines`. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a `region_code` and `address_lines` and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).",
