Message: {'description': "The `Registration` resource facilitates managing and configuring domain name registrations. There are several ways to create a new `Registration` resource: To create a new `Registration` resource, find a suitable domain name by calling the `SearchDomains` method with a query to see available domain name options. After choosing a name, call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` to ensure availability and obtain information like pricing, which is needed to build a call to `RegisterDomain`. Another way to create a new `Registration` is to transfer an existing domain from another registrar (Deprecated: For more information, see [Cloud Domains feature deprecation](https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/deprecations/feature-deprecations)). First, go to the current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain's transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to `TransferDomain`. Finally, you can create a new `Registration` by importing an existing domain managed with [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) (Deprecated: For more information, see [Cloud Domains feature deprecation](https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/deprecations/feature-deprecations)).
