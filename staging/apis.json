      "description": "### The Internet of Things for Everyone\n\nThe Adafruit IO HTTP API provides access to your Adafruit IO data from any programming language or hardware environment that can speak HTTP. The easiest way to get started is with [an Adafruit IO learn guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/adafruit-io-basics) and [a simple Internet of Things capable device like the Feather Huzzah](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821).\n\nThis API documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages and is available at [https://github.com/adafruit/io-api](https://github.com/adafruit/io-api). For questions or comments visit the [Adafruit IO Forums](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewforum.php?f=56) or the [adafruit-io channel on the Adafruit Discord server](https://discord.gg/adafruit).\n\n#### Authentication\n\nAuthentication for every API request happens through the `X-AIO-Key` header or query parameter and your IO API key. A simple cURL request to get all available feeds for a user with the username \"io_username\" and the key \"io_key_12345\" could look like this:\n\n    $ curl -H \"X-AIO-Key: io_key_12345\" https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/io_username/feeds\n\nOr like this:\n\n    $ curl \"https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/io_username/feeds?X-AIO-Key=io_key_12345\n\nUsing the node.js [request](https://github.com/request/request) library, IO HTTP requests are as easy as:\n\n```js\nvar request = require('request');\n\nvar options = {\n  url: 'https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/io_username/feeds',\n  headers: {\n    'X-AIO-Key': 'io_key_12345',\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n  }\n};\n\nfunction callback(error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    var feeds = JSON.parse(body);\n    console.log(feeds.length + \" FEEDS AVAILABLE\");\n\n    feeds.forEach(function (feed) {\n      console.log(feed.name, feed.key);\n    })\n  }\n}\n\nrequest(options, callback);\n```\n\nUsing the ESP8266 Arduino HTTPClient library, an HTTPS GET request would look like this (replacing `---` with your own values in the appropriate locations):\n\n```arduino\n/// based on\n/// https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/ESP8266HTTPClient/examples/Authorization/Authorization.ino\n\n#include <Arduino.h>\n#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>\n#include <ESP8266WiFiMulti.h>\n#include <ESP8266HTTPClient.h>\n\nESP8266WiFiMulti WiFiMulti;\n\nconst char* ssid = \"---\";\nconst char* password = \"---\";\n\nconst char* host = \"io.adafruit.com\";\n\nconst char* io_key = \"---\";\nconst char* path_with_username = \"/api/v2/---/dashboards\";\n\n// Use web browser to view and copy\n// SHA1 fingerprint of the certificate\nconst char* fingerprint = \"77 00 54 2D DA E7 D8 03 27 31 23 99 EB 27 DB CB A5 4C 57 18\";\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n\n  for(uint8_t t = 4; t > 0; t--) {\n    Serial.printf(\"[SETUP] WAIT %d...\\n\", t);\n    Serial.flush();\n    delay(1000);\n  }\n\n  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);\n  WiFiMulti.addAP(ssid, password);\n\n  // wait for WiFi connection\n  while(WiFiMulti.run() != WL_CONNECTED) {\n    Serial.print('.');\n    delay(1000);\n  }\n\n  Serial.println(\"[WIFI] connected!\");\n\n  HTTPClient http;\n\n  // start request with URL and TLS cert fingerprint for verification\n  http.begin(\"https://\" + String(host) + String(path_with_username), fingerprint);\n\n  // IO API authentication\n  http.addHeader(\"X-AIO-Key\", io_key);\n\n  // start connection and send HTTP header\n  int httpCode = http.GET();\n\n  // httpCode will be negative on error\n  if(httpCode > 0) {\n    // HTTP header has been send and Server response header has been handled\n    Serial.printf(\"[HTTP] GET response: %d\\n\", httpCode);\n\n    // HTTP 200 OK\n    if(httpCode == HTTP_CODE_OK) {\n      String payload = http.getString();\n      Serial.println(payload);\n    }\n\n    http.end();\n  }\n}\n\nvoid loop() {}\n```\n\n#### Client Libraries\n\nWe have client libraries to help you get started with your project: [Python](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-python), [Ruby](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-ruby), [Arduino C++](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Arduino), [Javascript](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-io-node), and [Go](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-go) are available. They're all open source, so if they don't already do what you want, you can fork and add any feature you'd like.\n\n",

For example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U \"ws@MarketPlace.YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\nWhen going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n \n## Versioning\nThe Hosted onboarding API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Hop/v6/getOnboardingUrl\n```",

This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v40/payout\n ```\n\n## Going live\n\nTo authenticate to the live endpoints, you need [API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v40/payout\n ```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",

      "description": "The Adyen [Terminal API](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/terminal-api/) lets you make payments, issue refunds, collect shopper information, and perform other shopper-terminal interactions using a payment terminal supplied by Adyen.\n \n## Authentication and endpoints\nAuthentication and endpoints depend on whether you are using a [cloud or a local](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/choose-your-architecture/) Terminal API integration.\n\n### Cloud\nEach request to the cloud Terminal API must be signed with an API key. [Generate your API Key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key) in the Customer Area and set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value.\n\nThe cloud Terminal API endpoint you need to use depends on whether your integration will receive transaction results synchronously or asynchronously:\n\n- Synchronous: `https://terminal-api-test.adyen.com/sync`\n- Asynchronous: `https://terminal-api-test.adyen.com/async`\n \nWhen you are ready to go live, you need to generate a new web service user credential and switch to one of the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/terminal-api/#cloud).\n \n### Local\nIf your integration uses local communications, API requests are made from a POS app directly to a terminal's IP address. To learn how to set up and protect local communications, refer to [Building a local integration](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/choose-your-architecture/local/).\n \n## API structure\nTerminal API communicates with the terminal using JSON messages. All requests and responses have the following structure:\n- `MessageHeader`: identifies the type of transaction, the terminal being used, and unique transaction identifiers.\n - **Request body**: a request or response object, depending on the type of transaction. For example, when you make a payment request this is a `PaymentRequest` object, and when you receive a payment response this is a `PaymentResponse` object.\n\n ### Requests\nEach Terminal API request you make is contained in a `SaletoPOIRequest` object and needs to have the following objects:\n* `MessageHeader`: for each request you need to include this object and specify the [required parameters](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/terminal-api/#request-message-header).\n * Request body: the name and structure of this object depends on the type of request. You can use this specification to create the structure of the request body. For example, to make a payment you need to include a `PaymentRequest` object and the `MessageHeader` inside the `SaletoPOIRequest` object.\n\n### Responses\nEach terminal API response you receive is contained in a `SaleToPOIResponse` object and includes:\n * `MessageHeader`: this object echoes the values you provided in the request. The only exception is the `MessageType`, which is always **Response**.\n* **Response body**: the values you receive in the response body depend on the type of transaction request you made. For example, when making a `PaymentRequest` you would receive a `PaymentResponse` as the response body.\n\nBelow, you can find the list of available Terminal API requests with the structure of the request/response body parameters:",

      "name": "Airflow API (Stable)",
      "description": "# Overview\n\nTo facilitate management, Apache Airflow supports a range of REST API endpoints across its\nobjects.\nThis section provides an overview of the API design, methods, and supported use cases.\n\nMost of the endpoints accept `JSON` as input and return `JSON` responses.\nThis means that you must usually add the following headers to your request:\n```\nContent-type: application/json\nAccept: application/json\n```\n\n## Resources\n\nThe term `resource` refers to a single type of object in the Airflow metadata. An API is broken up by its\nendpoint's corresponding resource.\nThe name of a resource is typically plural and expressed in camelCase. Example: `dagRuns`.\n\nResource names are used as part of endpoint URLs, as well as in API parameters and responses.\n\n## CRUD Operations\n\nThe platform supports **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete operations on most resources.\nYou can review the standards for these operations and their standard parameters below.\n\nSome endpoints have special behavior as exceptions.\n\n### Create\n\nTo create a resource, you typically submit an HTTP `POST` request with the resource's required metadata\nin the request body.\nThe response returns a `201 Created` response code upon success with the resource's metadata, including\nits internal `id`, in the response body.\n\n### Read\n\nThe HTTP `GET` request can be used to read a resource or to list a number of resources.\n\nA resource's `id` can be submitted in the request parameters to read a specific resource.\nThe response usually returns a `200 OK` response code upon success, with the resource's metadata in\nthe response body.\n\nIf a `GET` request does not include a specific resource `id`, it is treated as a list request.\nThe response usually returns a `200 OK` response code upon success, with an object containing a list\nof resources' metadata in the response body.\n\nWhen reading resources, some common query parameters are usually available. e.g.:\n```\nv1/connections?limit=25&offset=25\n```\n\n|Query Parameter|Type|Description|\n|---------------|----|-----------|\n|limit|integer|Maximum number of objects to fetch. Usually 25 by default|\n|offset|integer|Offset after which to start returning objects. For use with limit query parameter.|\n\n### Update\n\nUpdating a resource requires the resource `id`, and is typically done using an HTTP `PATCH` request,\nwith the fields to modify in the request body.\nThe response usually returns a `200 OK` response code upon success, with information about the modified\nresource in the response body.\n\n### Delete\n\nDeleting a resource requires the resource `id` and is typically executed via an HTTP `DELETE` request.\nThe response usually returns a `204 No Content` response code upon success.\n\n## Conventions\n\n- Resource names are plural and expressed in camelCase.\n- Names are consistent between URL parameter name and field name.\n\n- Field names are in snake_case.\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": \"string\",\n    \"name\": \"string\",\n    \"occupied_slots\": 0,\n    \"open_slots\": 0\n    \"queued_slots\": 0,\n    \"running_slots\": 0,\n    \"scheduled_slots\": 0,\n    \"slots\": 0,\n}\n```\n\n### Update Mask\n\nUpdate mask is available as a query parameter in patch endpoints. It is used to notify the\nAPI which fields you want to update. Using `update_mask` makes it easier to update objects\nby helping the server know which fields to update in an object instead of updating all fields.\nThe update request ignores any fields that aren't specified in the field mask, leaving them with\ntheir current values.\n\nExample:\n```\n  resource = request.get('/resource/my-id').json()\n  resource['my_field'] = 'new-value'\n  request.patch('/resource/my-id?update_mask=my_field', data=json.dumps(resource))\n```\n\n## Versioning and Endpoint Lifecycle\n\n- API versioning is not synchronized to specific releases of the Apache Airflow.\n- APIs are designed to be backward compatible.\n- Any changes to the API will first go through a deprecation phase.\n\n# Trying the API\n\nYou can use a third party client, such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/),\n[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [the Insomnia rest client](https://insomnia.rest/) to test\nthe Apache Airflow API.\n\nNote that you will need to pass credentials data.\n\nFor e.g., here is how to pause a DAG with [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), when basic authorization is used:\n```bash\ncurl -X PATCH 'https://example.com/api/v1/dags/{dag_id}?update_mask=is_paused' \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--user \"username:password\" \\\n-d '{\n    \"is_paused\": true\n}'\n```\n\nUsing a graphical tool such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/),\nit is possible to import the API specifications directly:\n\n1. Download the API specification by clicking the **Download** button at the top of this document\n2. Import the JSON specification in the graphical tool of your choice.\n  - In *Postman*, you can click the **import** button at the top\n  - With *Insomnia*, you can just drag-and-drop the file on the UI\n\nNote that with *Postman*, you can also generate code snippets by selecting a request and clicking on\nthe **Code** button.\n\n## Enabling CORS\n\n[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)\nis a browser security feature that restricts HTTP requests that are\ninitiated from scripts running in the browser.\n\nFor details on enabling/configuring CORS, see\n[Enabling CORS](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/api.html).\n\n# Authentication\n\nTo be able to meet the requirements of many organizations, Airflow supports many authentication methods,\nand it is even possible to add your own method.\n\nIf you want to check which auth backend is currently set, you can use\n`airflow config get-value api auth_backends` command as in the example below.\n```bash\n$ airflow config get-value api auth_backends\nairflow.api.auth.backend.basic_auth\n```\nThe default is to deny all requests.\n\nFor details on configuring the authentication, see\n[API Authorization](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/api.html).\n\n# Errors\n\nWe follow the error response format proposed in [RFC 7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807)\nalso known as Problem Details for HTTP APIs. As with our normal API responses,\nyour client must be prepared to gracefully handle additional members of the response.\n\n## Unauthenticated\n\nThis indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication\ncredentials for the target resource. Please check that you have valid credentials.\n\n## PermissionDenied\n\nThis response means that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize\nit because it lacks sufficient rights to the resource. It happens when you do not have the\nnecessary permission to execute the action you performed. You need to get the appropriate\npermissions in other to resolve this error.\n\n## BadRequest\n\nThis response means that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something\nthat is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message\nframing, or deceptive request routing). To resolve this, please ensure that your syntax is correct.\n\n## NotFound\n\nThis client error response indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource.\n\n## MethodNotAllowed\n\nIndicates that the request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource.\n\n## NotAcceptable\n\nThe target resource does not have a current representation that would be acceptable to the user\nagent, according to the proactive negotiation header fields received in the request, and the\nserver is unwilling to supply a default representation.\n\n## AlreadyExists\n\nThe request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target\nresource, e.g. the resource it tries to create already exists.\n\n## Unknown\n\nThis means that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from\nfulfilling the request.\n",

API access is only allowed with SSL encrypted connection (https).\n# Authentication\nURL query authentication with an API key is used, so appending `?api_key={api_key}` to the URL where `{api_key}` is found within Apacta settings is used for authentication\n# Pagination\nIf the endpoint returns a `pagination` object it means the endpoint supports pagination - currently it's only possible to change pages with `?page={page_number}` but implementing custom page sizes are on the road map.\n\n\n# Search/filter\nIs experimental but implemented in some cases - see the individual endpoints' docs for further explanation.\n# Ordering\nIs currently experimental, but on some endpoints it's implemented on URL querys so eg. to order Invoices by `invoice_number` appending `?sort=Invoices.invoice_number&direction=desc` would sort the list descending by the value of `invoice_number`.\n# Project Files\nCurrently project files can be retrieved from two endpoints. `/projects/{project_id}/files` handles files uploaded from wall posts or forms. `/projects/{project_id}/project_files` allows uploading and showing files, not belonging to specific form or wall post.\n# Errors/Exceptions\n## 422 (Validation)\nWrite something about how the `errors` object contains keys with the properties that failes validation like:\n```\n  {\n      \"success\": false,\n      \"data\": {\n          \"code\": 422,\n          \"url\": \"/api/v1/contacts?api_key=5523be3b-30ef-425d-8203-04df7caaa93a\",\n          \"message\": \"A validation error occurred\",\n          \"errorCount\": 1,\n          \"errors\": {\n              \"contact_types\": [ ##

Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response.

Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php), [Python](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/python) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://requests.apideck.io/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will not be able to make further requests until you upgrade your subscription. Please reach out to sales@apideck.com to continue making requests.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to use Apideck with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**, **18.156.9.3**, **3.65.139.215**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n",

Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             |\n| Authorization         | String  | Yes      | Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php), [Python](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/python) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://requests.apideck.io/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to use Apideck with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**, **18.156.9.3**, **3.65.139.215**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n",

      "description": "Welcome to the Connector API.\n\nYou can use this API to access all Connector API endpoints.\n\n## Base URL\n\nThe base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`\n\n## Headers\n\nCustom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             |\n| Authorization         | String  | Yes      | Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php), [Python](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/python) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://requests.apideck.io/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response. The response message varies, depending on the request method and the requested data.                                |\n| 201  | Created              | The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.                                                                                                              |\n| 204  | No Content           | The server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body.                                                                          |\n| 400  | Bad Request          | The receiving server cannot understand the request because of malformed syntax. Do not repeat the request without first modifying it; check the request for errors, fix them and then retry the request. |\n| 401  | Unauthorized         | The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.                                                                                              |\n| 402  | Payment Required     | Subscription data is incomplete or out of date. You'll need to provide payment details to continue.                                                                                                      |\n| 403  | Forbidden            | You do not have the appropriate user rights to access the request. Do not repeat the request.                                                                                                            |\n| 404  | Not Found            | The origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.                                                                           |\n| 409  | Conflict             | The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.                                                                                                      |\n| 422  | Unprocessable Entity | The server understands the content type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct but was unable to process the contained instructions.                                     |\n| 429  | Too Many Requests    | You sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\"rate limit\"). Try again later                                                                                                                     |\n| 5xx  | Server Errors        | Something went wrong with the Unify API. These errors are logged on our side. You can contact our team to resolve the issue.                                                                             |\n\n### Handling errors\n\nThe Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to misconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.\n\n### Error Types\n\n#### RequestValidationError\n\nRequest is not valid for the current endpoint. The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will not be able to make further requests until you upgrade your subscription. Please reach out to sales@apideck.com to continue making requests.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute.

For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier.

If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100.

Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             |\n| Authorization         | String  | Yes      | Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php), [Python](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/python) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://requests.apideck.io/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will not be able to make further requests until you upgrade your subscription. Please reach out to sales@apideck.com to continue making requests.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to use Apideck with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**, **18.156.9.3**, **3.65.139.215**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n",

Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Idempotence (upcoming)\n\nTo prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.\n\nUniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will not be able to make further requests until you upgrade your subscription. Please reach out to sales@apideck.com to continue making requests.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to use Apideck with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**, **18.156.9.3**, **3.65.139.215**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n",

Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response.

Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php), [Python](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/python) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://requests.apideck.io/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will not be able to make further requests until you upgrade your subscription. Please reach out to sales@apideck.com to continue making requests.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to use Apideck with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**, **18.156.9.3**, **3.65.139.215**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n",

Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             |\n| Authorization         | String  | Yes      | Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php), [Python](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/python) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://requests.apideck.io/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to use Apideck with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**, **18.156.9.3**, **3.65.139.215**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n",

      "description": "Welcome to the Issue Tracking API.\n\nYou can use this API to access all Issue Tracking API endpoints.\n\n## Base URL\n\nThe base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`\n\n## Headers\n\nCustom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The application id of your Unify application. Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             |\n| Authorization         | String  | Yes      | Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php), [Python](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/python) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://requests.apideck.io/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response. The response message varies, depending on the request method and the requested data.                                |\n| 201  | Created              | The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.                                                                                                              |\n| 204  | No Content           | The server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body.                                                                          |\n| 400  | Bad Request          | The receiving server cannot understand the request because of malformed syntax. Do not repeat the request without first modifying it; check the request for errors, fix them and then retry the request. |\n| 401  | Unauthorized         | The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.                                                                                              |\n| 402  | Payment Required     | Subscription data is incomplete or out of date.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will not be able to make further requests until you upgrade your subscription. Please reach out to sales@apideck.com to continue making requests.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed.

Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to use Apideck with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**, **18.156.9.3**, **3.65.139.215**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n",

Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php), [Python](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/python) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://requests.apideck.io/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will not be able to make further requests until you upgrade your subscription. Please reach out to sales@apideck.com to continue making requests.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to use Apideck with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**, **18.156.9.3**, **3.65.139.215**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n",

Available at https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys.                                                             |\n| Authorization         | String  | Yes      | Bearer API KEY                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Authorization\n\nYou can interact with the API through the authorization methods below.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API resources have support for bulk retrieval via list APIs.  Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php), [Python](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/python) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://requests.apideck.io/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will not be able to make further requests until you upgrade your subscription. Please reach out to sales@apideck.com to continue making requests.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to use Apideck with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**, **18.156.9.3**, **3.65.139.215**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n",

Each Unify application is assigned a single API key. You can locate your API key in the Configuration Settings section of your Apideck application. Additionally, your application’s application_id is available on the same page.\n\nAuthenticate your API requests by including your test or live secret API key in the request header.\n\n- Bearer authorization header: Authorization: Bearer \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"\n- Application id header: x-apideck-app-id: \"YOUR_APP_ID_HERE\"\n  You should use the public keys on the SDKs and the secret keys to authenticate API requests.\n\n**Do not share or include your secret API keys on client side code.** Your API keys carry significant privileges. Please ensure to keep them 100% secure and be sure to not share your secret API keys in areas that are publicly accessible like GitHub.\n\nLearn how to set the Authorization header inside Postman https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/authorization/#api-key\n\nGo to Unify to grab your API KEY https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys\n\n| Security Scheme Type      | HTTP   |\n| ------------------------- | ------ |\n| HTTP Authorization Scheme | bearer |\n\n### applicationId\n\nThe ID of your Unify application\n\n| Security Scheme Type  | API Key          |\n| --------------------- | ---------------- |\n| Header parameter name | x-apideck-app-id |\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to use Apideck with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**, **18.156.9.3**, **3.65.139.215**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Timeout\n\nThe request timeout is set at 30 seconds.\n\n### Response Size\n\nThe Proxy API has no response size limit. For responses larger than 2MB, the Proxy API will redirect to a temporary URL. In this case the usual Apideck response headers will be returned in the redirect response. Most HTTP clients will handle this redirect automatically.\n\n```\nGET /proxy\n< 301 Moved Permanently\n< x-apideck-request-id: {{requestId}}\n< Location: {{temporaryUrl}}\n\nGET {{temporaryUrl}}\n< {{responseBody}}\n```\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will not be able to make further requests until you upgrade your subscription. Please reach out to sales@apideck.com to continue making requests.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n",

Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-consumer-id | String  | Yes      | The id of the customer stored inside Apideck Vault. This can be a user id, account id, device id or whatever entity that can have integration within your app. |\n| x-apideck-service-id  | String  | No       | Describe the service you want to call (e.g., pipedrive). Only needed when a customer has activated multiple integrations for the same Unified API.             |\n| x-apideck-raw         | Boolean | No       | Include raw response. Mostly used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                      |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The application id of your Unify application.

Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php), [Python](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/python) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://requests.apideck.io/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to use Apideck with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**, **18.156.9.3**, **3.65.139.215**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n",

      "description": "Welcome to the Vault API 👋\n\nWhen you're looking to connect to an API, the first step is authentication.\n\nVault helps you handle OAuth flows, store API keys, and refresh access tokens from users (called consumers in Apideck).\n\n## Base URL\n\nThe base URL for all API requests is `https://unify.apideck.com`\n\n## Get Started\n\nTo use the Apideck APIs, you need to sign up for free at [https://app.apideck.com/signup](). Follow the steps below to get started.\n\n- [Create a free account.](https://app.apideck.com/signup)\n- Go to the [Dashboard](https://app.apideck.com/unify/unified-apis/dashboard).\n- Get your API key and the application ID.\n- Select and configure the integrations you want to make available to your users. Through the Unify dashboard, you can configure which connectors you want to support as integrations.\n- Retrieve the client_id and client_secret for the integration you want to activate (Only needed for OAuth integrations).\n- Register the redirect URI for the example app (https://unify.apideck.com/vault/callback) in the list of redirect URIs under your app's settings.\n\n### Vault JS\n\n[Vault JS](https://developers.apideck.com/guides/vault) is a vanilla JavaScript library to embed Apideck Vault in any web application.\n\n[Follow this guide](https://developers.apideck.com/guides/vault) to get started \n\n### Hosted Vault\n\nHosted Vault (vault.apideck.com) is a no-code solution, so you don't need to build your own UI to handle the integration settings and authentication.\n\n![Hosted Vault - Integrations portal](https://github.com/apideck-samples/integration-settings/raw/master/public/img/vault.png)\n\nBehind the scenes, Hosted Vault implements the Vault API endpoints and handles the following features for your customers:\n\n- Add a connection\n- Handle the OAuth flow\n- Configure connection settings per integration\n- Manage connections\n- Discover and propose integration options\n\nTo use Hosted Vault, you will need to first [**create a session**](https://developers.apideck.com/apis/vault/reference#tag/Sessions/operation/sessionsCreate). This can be achieved by making a POST request to the Vault API to create a valid session for a user, hereafter referred to as the consumer ID.\n\n### Vault API\n\n_Beware, this strategy takes more time to implement in comparison to Vault JS and Hosted Vault._\n\nIf you are building your integration settings UI manually, you can call the Vault API directly.\n\nThe Vault API is for those who want to completely white label the in-app integrations overview and authentication experience. All the available endpoints are listed below.\n\nThrough the API, your customers authenticate directly in your app, where Vault will still take care of redirecting to the auth provider and back to your app.\n\nIf you're already storing access tokens, we will help you migrate through our Vault Migration API.\n\n## Domain model\n\nAt its core, a domain model creates a web of interconnected entities.\n\nOur domain model contains five main entity types: Consumer (user, account, team, machine), Application, Connector, Integration, and Connection.\n\n## Connection state\n\nThe connection state is computed based on the connection flow below.\n\n![](https://developers.apideck.com/api-references/vault/connection-flow.png)\n\n## Unify and Proxy integration\n\nThe only thing you need to use the Unify APIs and Proxy is the consumer id; thereafter, Vault will do the look-up in the background to handle the token injection before performing the API call(s).\n\n## Headers\n\nCustom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.\n\n| Name                  | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| x-apideck-app-id      | String  | Yes      | The id of your Unify application.

Can I just handle the authentication and access token myself?**\nYou can store everything yourself, but that defeats the purpose of using Apideck Unify. Handling tokens for multiple providers can quickly become very complex.\n\n### Is my data secure?\n\nVault employs data minimization, therefore only requesting the minimum amount of scopes needed to perform an API request.\n\n### How do I migrate existing data?\n\nUsing our migration endpoints, you can [import access tokens and accounts](https://developers.apideck.com/guides/migrating-integrations) to Apideck Vault.\n\n### Can I use Vault in combination with existing integrations?\n\nYes, you can. The flexibility of Unify allows you to quickly the use cases you need while keeping a gradual migration path based on your timeline and requirements. \n\n### How to integrate Apideck Vault\n\nThis section covers everything you need to know to authenticate your customers through Vault.\nVault provides **three auth strategies** to use API tokens from your customers:\n\n- [Vault JS](https://developers.apideck.com/guides/vault) (recommended)\n- Vault API\n- Hosted Vault (advanced)\n\n### What auth types does Vault support?\n\nWhat auth strategies does Vault handle? We currently support three flows so your customers can activate an integration.\n\n#### API keys\n\nFor Services supporting the API key strategy, you can use Hosted Vault will need to provide an in-app form where users can configure their API keys provided by the integration service.\n\n#### OAuth 2.0\n\n##### Authorization Code Grant Type Flow\n\nVault handles the complete Authorization Code Grant Type Flow for you. This flow only supports browser-based (passive) authentication because most identity providers don't allow entering a username and password to be entered into applications that they don't own.\n\nCertain connectors require an OAuth redirect authentication flow, where the end-user is redirected to the provider's website or mobile app to authenticate.\n\nThis is being handled by the `/authorize` endpoint.\n\n#### Basic auth\n\nBasic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The required fields to complete basic auth are handled by Hosted Vault or by updating the connection through the Vault API below.\n\nYou can learn more about [API Auth methods](https://www.apideck.com/blog/api-auth-authentication-methods-and-examples) in our guide.\n",

Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional `cursor` and `limit` parameters.\n\nTo fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a `cursor` parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in `meta.cursors.next`. If `meta.cursors.next` is `null` you're at the end of the list.\n\nIn the REST API you can also use the `links` from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in `links.next` to get the next page of results.\n\n### Query Parameters\n\n| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                        |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| cursor | String | No       | Cursor to start from. You can find cursors for next & previous pages in the meta.cursors property of the response. |\n| limit  | Number | No       | Number of results to return. Minimum 1, Maximum 200, Default 20                                                    |\n\n### Response Body\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| meta.cursors.previous | String | Cursor to navigate to the previous page of results through the API |\n| meta.cursors.current  | String | Cursor to navigate to the current page of results through the API  |\n| meta.cursors.next     | String | Cursor to navigate to the next page of results through the API     |\n| meta.items_on_page    | Number | Number of items returned in the data property of the response      |\n| links.previous        | String | Link to navigate to the previous page of results through the API   |\n| links.current         | String | Link to navigate to the current page of results through the API    |\n| links.next            | String | Link to navigate to the next page of results through the API       |\n\n⚠️ `meta.cursors.previous`/`links.previous` is not available for all connectors.\n\n## SDKs and API Clients\n\nWe currently offer a [Node.js](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/node), [PHP](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/php), [Python](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/python) and [.NET](https://developers.apideck.com/sdks/dot-net) SDK.\nNeed another SDK? [Request the SDK of your choice](https://requests.apideck.io/request).\n\n## Debugging\n\nBecause of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.\n\n| Code | Title                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200  | OK                   | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response.

The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.\n\n#### UnsupportedFiltersError\n\nFilters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.\n\n#### UnsupportedSortFieldError\n\nSort field (`sort[by]`) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.\n\n#### InvalidCursorError\n\nPagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.\n\n#### ConnectorExecutionError\n\nA Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The `status_code` returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.\n\n#### UnauthorizedError\n\nWe were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: `Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_***'`\n\n#### ConnectorCredentialsError\n\nA request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.\n\n#### ConnectorDisabledError\n\nA request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### ConnectorRateLimitError\n\nYou sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.\n\n#### RequestLimitError\n\nYou have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will not be able to make further requests until you upgrade your subscription. Please reach out to sales@apideck.com to continue making requests.\n\n#### EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.\n\n#### OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError\n\nWhen adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a `client_id` and `client_secret` must be provided before any authorizations can be performed. Verify the integration has been configured properly before continuing.\n\n#### IntegrationNotFoundError\n\nThe requested connector integration could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Verify your `application_id` is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.\n\n#### ConnectionNotFoundError\n\nA valid connection could not be found associated to your `application_id`. Something _may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.\n\n#### ConnectionSettingsError\n\nThe connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify `connection.settings` contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.\n\n#### ConnectorNotFoundError\n\nA request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your `service_id` is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided `unified_api`.\n\n#### OAuthRedirectUriError\n\nA request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid `redirect_uri`. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.\n\n#### OAuthInvalidStateError\n\nThe state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.\n\n#### OAuthCodeExchangeError\n\nWhen attempting to exchange the authorization code for an `access_token` during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.\n\n#### OAuthConnectorError\n\nIt seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### MappingError\n\nThere was an error attempting to retrieve the mapping for a given attribute. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorMappingNotFoundError\n\nIt seems the implementation for this connector is incomplete. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorResponseMappingNotFoundError\n\nWe were unable to retrieve the response mapping for this connector. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationMappingNotFoundError\n\nConnector mapping has not been implemented for the requested operation. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorWorkflowMappingError\n\nThe composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n#### ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError\n\nYou're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.\n\n#### PaginationNotSupportedError\n\nPagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in `beta` or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.\n\n## API Design\n\n### API Styles and data formats\n\n#### REST API\n\nThe API is organized around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.\n\n##### Available HTTP methods\n\nThe Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.\n\n```\nPOST /messages\nGET /messages\nGET /messages/{messageId}\nPATCH /messages/{messageId}\nDELETE /messages/{messageId}\n```\n\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.\n\n### Schema\n\nAll API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.\n\n### Meta\n\nMeta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.\n\n### Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n### Fixed field types\n\n#### Dates\n\nThe dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).\n\nThis example `2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.\n\nThe ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.\n\n#### Prices and Currencies\n\nAll prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).\n\nFor zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.\n\nAll currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.\n\n## Static IP\n\nSome of the APIs you want to use can require a static IP. Apideck's static IP feature allows you to use Apideck with a fixed IP avoiding the need for you to set up your own infrastructure. This feature is currently available to all Apideck customers.\nTo use this feature, the API Vendor will need to whitelist the associated static IP addresses.\nThe provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.\n\n- EU Central 1: **18.197.244.247**, **18.156.9.3**, **3.65.139.215**\n- Other: upcoming\n\n  More info about our data security can be found at [https://compliance.apideck.com/](https://compliance.apideck.com/)\n\n",

      "description": "The ART19 Content API conforms to the [JSON:API specification](http://jsonapi.org).\n\nAPI requests **MUST** use the HTTP Accept header:\n\n`Accept: application/vnd.api+json`\n\nAPI requests **MUST** be authenticated using the HTTP Authorization header:\n\n`Authorization: Token token=\"your-token\", credential=\"your-credential\"`\n\n## General Notes\n\nSome query parameters use unencoded [ and ] characters simply for readability. Defaults, examples, and\npossible values are additionally rendered in double quotes for readability. In practice, query parameters should\nnot have quotes around the values (e.g., `foo=bar` is valid, not `foo=\"bar\"`), and both query parameter keys\nand values must be percent-encoded, per the requirements in [RFC 3986 § 3.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.4).\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\nIn order to provide a fair distribution of available resources, all API calls are subject to rate limits.\nIf you exceed the number of API calls per minute granted to your credential, a `429 Too Many Requests`\nerror response will be returned.\n\nIn that case, a `Retry-After` header MAY be included in the response, describing the number of seconds\nafter which a request can be retried.\n\nIf you run into a high number of 429 errors, please reach out to ART19 Support to adjust your rate limit.\n\n### Example\n\nIn the following example the request can be retried after waiting for 21 seconds:\n\n    HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests\n    Content-Type: text/html\n    Retry-After: 21\n\n## Pagination\n\nRequests to collection endpoints **SHOULD** provide pagination parameters.\nSome endpoints **REQUIRE** pagination parameters to be provided.\nWhenever pagination is provided, it **MUST** be valid.\nFailing to provide pagination when it is required or providing wrong or incomplete pagination\nalways results in a `400 Bad Request` error response.\n\nThe page numbering starts with `1` and the maximum page size (if not otherwise documented\non an endpoint) is `100`. Pagination **MUST NOT** be specified if requesting a list of IDs (using an `ids[]` parameter).\n\nProviding invalid values for page number or page size, as well as providing only a page number or only a page size,\nis considered an error. Pagination is provided like this:\n\n`page[number]=1&page[size]=25`\n\nResponses conform to the [JSON:API specification's pagination section](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination)\nby including pagination links. Your requested page size will be carried into the pagination links.\n\n## Sorting\n\nRequests to collection endpoints usually accept a `sort` parameter. Please refer to the\n[JSON:API Specification's sorting section](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sorting) for further details.\n\n## Relationship Linking\n\nCurrently, resources return all of their relationships, in no particular order, pursuant to how relationships\nshould be returned [according to the JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-relationships). Consumers of this API\n**MUST NOT** make assumptions about the order of these collections. Even though this data is not currently paginated, consumers **MUST** support\npaginating relationships per the JSON:API specification if this data is important for their application.\n",

      "description": "# Introduction\nThe SearchLy API provides similarity searching based on song lyrics.\n\n# Operations\nThe API allows for the `/similarity/by_song` operation, which allows clients to search the similarity for an existing song in the database. Also, the API has an additional `/similarity/by_content` endpoint which allows clients to search similarity given a free String input through a JSON request body. Additional `/song/search` operation is available for searching songs given a query String.\n\n# Endpoint\nThe API endpoint for the SearchLy API v1 is as follows:\n```\nhttps://searchly.asuarez.dev/api/v1\n```\n\n# Motivation\nThis project was built in order to create an API for searching similarities based on song lyrics. There are a lot of songs in the industry and most of them are talking about the same topic. What I wanted to prove with SearchLy was to estimate how similar are two songs between them based on the meaning of their lyrics.\n\nSearchLy is using a database of 100k songs from AZLyrics, using [this scraper](https://github.com/AlbertSuarez/azlyrics-scraper), which is being updated periodically. Then, using word2vec and NMSLIB, it was possible to create an index where you can search similarities using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.\n\n> **Note**: I am currently using a micro-instance from DigitalOcean where the API is deployed, so you should expect a bad performance. However, if this API becomes popular I will deploy it in a bigger instance.\n",

      "description": "The SEDRA API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and uses [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) for documentation.\n# Introduction\nThis document describes the JSON API for the Syriac Electronic Data Research Archive (SEDRA). The SEDRA project is a linguistic and literary database of Syriac language and literature focusing on providing electronic access to the corpus of Syriac lexicons with linguistic information added to each entry in those lexicons. The API is a mechanism to provide the linguistic information stored in SEDRA to a broader audience.\nAdditionally there is a XML API for Syriac words which conforms to a prototype Semitic Languages schema which can be found in the XSD file https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/semiticLanguages.xsd.\n# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\nThis API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with the [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) and allows cross-domain communication from the browser.\nAll responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.\n# Samples\nExplaining how to lookup words in the SEDRA API is complex and would clutter the API description. For that reason we have chosen to give the explanation of how to lookup words in its own section. SEDRA can lookup words by the SEDRA word Id. However, it will often be the case that the consumer of information provided by the SEDRA API does not know the SEDRA word Id. It is for that reason that the SEDRA API provides a method to lookup words by the Syriac text. But that process is complicated by the nature of Syriac writing. So the SEDRA API will lookup words for consonantal, partially vocalized, and fully vocalized Syriac text. Using the word Id will provide the most accurate results as the exact word will be returned. Fully vocalized text will provide the next most accurate result. The least accurate results will be returned by partially vocalized and consonantal Syriac words in that order. Following are some samples to help understand how this works.\n1. By Word Id [30862](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/word/30862.json)\n2. By fully vocalized Syriac word [ܐܰܒܳܪܳܐ](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/word/ܐܰܒܳܪܳܐ.json)\n3. By partially vocalized Syriac word [ܐܶܒܪܐ](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/word/ܐܶܒܪܐ.json)\n4. By consonantal Syriac word [ܐܒܪܐ](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/word/ܐܒܪܐ.json).",

      "description": "#Documentation\r\n\r\nThis is the documentation for the partner endpoint of the BigOven Recipe and Grocery List API.\r\n\r\nThe update brings with it Swagger-based documentation. [Swagger](http://swagger.io) is an emerging standard for describing REST-based APIs, and with this Swagger-compliant endpoint (above), you can make ready-to-go interface libraries for your code via [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen). For instance, it's easy to generate libraries for Node.js, Java, Ruby, ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, php and more!\r\n\r\nYou can also try out the endpoint calls with your own api_key right here on this page. Be sure to enter your api_key above to use the \"Try it out!\" buttons on this page.\r\n\r\n##Start Here\r\n\r\nDevelopers new to the BigOven Build API should start with this version, not with the legacy API. We'll be making improvements to this API over time, and doing only bug fixes on the v1 API.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pretend you're a BigOven user (for instance, to get your recently viewed recipes or your grocery list), you need to pass in Basic Authentication information in the header, just as with the v1 API. We do now require that you make all calls via https. You need to pass your api_key in with every call, though this can now be done on the header (send a request header \"X-BigOven-API-Key\" set to your api_key value, e.g., Request[\"X-BigOven-API-Key\"]=\"your-key-here\".)\r\n\r\n##Migration Notes\r\n\r\nFor existing partners, we encourage you to [migrate](https://api2.bigoven.com), and while at this writing we have no hard-and-fast termination date for the v1 API, we strongly prefer that you migrate by January 1, 2017. While the changes aren't overly complex, there are several breaking changes, including refactoring of recipe search and results and removal of support for XML. This is not a simply plug-and-play replacement to the v1 API. With respect to an exclusive focus on JSON, the world has spoken, and it prefers JSON for REST-based API's. We've taken numerous steps to refactor the API to make it more REST-compliant. Note that this v2 API will be the preferred API from this point onward, so we encourage developers to migrate to this new format. We have put together some [migration notes](/web/documentation/migration-to-v2) that we encourage you to read carefully.\r\n\r\n##Photos\r\n\r\nSee our [photos documentation](https://api2.bigoven.com/web/documentation/recipe-images). \r\n\r\nFor more information on usage of this API, including features, pricing, rate limits, terms and conditions, please visit the [BigOven Build API website](https://api2.bigoven.com).",

      "name": "BulkSMS JSON REST API",
      "description": "## Overview\n\nThe JSON REST API allows you to submit and receive [BulkSMS](https://www.bulksms.com/) messages. You can also get access to past messages and see your account profile.\n\nThe base URL to use for this service is `https://api.bulksms.com/v1`.  The base URL cannot be used on its own; you must append a path that identifies an operation and you may have to specify some path parameters as well.\n\n[Click here](/developer/) to go to the main BulkSMS developer site.\n\nIn order to give you an idea on how the API can be used, some JSON snippets are provided below.  Have a look at the [messages section](#tag/Message) for more information.\n\nProbably the most simple example\n\n```\n{\n    \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n    \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n}\n```\n\n\nYou can send unicode automatically using the `auto-unicode` query parameter. \nAlternatively, you can specify `UNICODE` for the `encoding` property in the request body. \nPlease note: when `auto-unicode` is specified and the value of the `encoding` property is `UNICODE`, the message will always be sent as `UNICODE`.\n\nHere is an example that sets the `encoding` explicitly\n\n```\n{\n  \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n  \"body\": \"Dobrá práce! Jak se máš?\",\n  \"encoding\": \"UNICODE\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can also specify a from number\n\n```\n{\n    \"from\": \"+27007654321\",\n    \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n    \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n}\n```\n\nSimilar to above, but repliable\n\n```\n{\n    \"from\": { \"type\": \"REPLIABLE\" },\n    \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n    \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n}\n```\n\nA message to a group called Everyone\n\n```\n{\n    \"to\": { \"type\": \"GROUP\", \"name\": \"Everyone\" },\n    \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n}\n```\n\nA message to multiple recipients\n\n```\n{\n    \"to\": [\"+27001234567\", \"+27002345678\", \"+27003456789\"],\n    \"body\": \"Happy Holidays!\"\n}\n```\n\nSending more than one message in the same request\n\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n        \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"to\": \"+27002345678\",\n        \"body\": \"Hello Universe!\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n**The insecure base URL `http://api.bulksms.com/v1` is deprecated** and may in future result in a `301` redirect response, or insecure requests may be rejected outright. Please use the secure (`https`) URI above.\n\n### HTTP Content Type\n\nAll API methods expect requests to supply a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json`. All responses will have the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.\n\n### JSON Formatting\n\nYou are advised to format your JSON resources according to strict JSON format rules. While the API does attempt to parse strictly invalid JSON documents, doing so may lead to incorrect interpretation and unexpected results.\n\nGood JSON libraries will produce valid JSON suitable for submission, but if you are manually generating the JSON text, be careful to follow the JSON format. This include correct escaping of control characters and double quoting of property names.\n\nSee the [JSON specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627) for further information.\n\n### Date Formatting\n\nDates are formatted according to ISO-8601, such as `1970-01-01T10:00:00+01:00` for 1st January 1970, 10AM UTC+1.\n\nSee the [Wikipedia ISO 8601 reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for further information.\n\nSpecifically, calendar dates are formatted with the 'extended' format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Basic format, week dates and ordinal dates are not supported. Times are also formatted in the 'extended' format `hh:mm:ss`. Hours, minutes and seconds are mandatory. Offset from UTC must be provided; this is to ensure that there is no misunderstanding regarding times provided to the API.\n\nThe format we look for is `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss[Z|[+-]hh:mm]`\n\nExamples of valid date/times are`2011-12-31T12:00:00Z` `2011-12-31T12:00:00+02:00`\n\n### Entity Format Modifications\n\nIt is expected that over time some changes will be made to the request and response formats of various methods available in the API.\nWhere possible, these will be implemented in a backwards compatible way.\nTo make this possible you are required to ignore unknown properties.\nThis enables the addition of information in response documents while maintaining compatibility with older clients.\n\n### Optional Request Entity Properties\n\nThere are many instances where requests can be made without having to specify every single property allowable in the request format.\nAny such optional properties are noted as such in the documentation and their default value is noted.\n",

      "description": "**Last Modified**: Mon Jan  6 20:04:22 UTC 2025\n\n\nAll endpoints are only accessible via HTTPS.\n\n* All API endpoints are located at `https://platform.climate.com` (e.g.\n`https://platform.climate.com/v4/fields`).\n\n* The authorization token endpoint is located at\n`https://api.climate.com/api/oauth/token`.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n`X-Http-Request-Id` response header will be returned on every call,\nsuccessful or not. If you experience an issue with our api and need\nto contact technical support, please supply the value of the `X-Http-Request-Id`\nheader along with an approximate time of when the request was made.\n\n## Request Limits\n\nWhen you’re onboarded to Climate’s API platform, your `x-api-key` is assigned a custom usage plan. Usage plans are unique to each partner and have the following key attributes: \n\n1. Throttling information\n    * burstLimit: Maximum rate limit over a period ranging from 1 second to a few seconds\n    * rateLimit: A steady-state rate limit\n\n2. Quota information\n    * Limit: The maximum number of requests that can be made in a given month\n\nWhen the request rate threshold is exceeded, a `429` response code is returned. Optionally, the [`Retry-After`](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.37) header may be returned: \n\nFollowing are examples of rate limit errors:\n\n1. Rate limit exceeded:\n\n<br>HTTP/1.1 429 \n<br>Content-Type: application/json\n<br>Content-Length: 32\n\n   {\"message\":\"Too Many Requests\"}\n\n2. Quota exhausted:\n<br>HTTP/1.1 429 \n<br>Content-Type: application/json\n<br>Content-Length: 29\n\n    {\"message\":\"Limit Exceeded\"}\n\n## Pagination\n\nPagination is performed via headers. Any request which returns a `\"results\"`\narray may be paginated. The following figure shows how query results are laid out with\nX-Limit=4 and no filter applied.\n\n<img style=\"width:70%;height:auto;\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/climate-com/images/svg_upload_tests/paging.png\">\n\n* If there are no results, a response code of `304` will be returned.\n\n* If the response is the last set of results, a response code of `200` or\n`206` will be returned.\n\n* If there are more results, a response code of `206` will be returned.\n\n* If `X-Next-Token` is provided in the request headers but the token has\nexpired, a response code of `409` will be returned. This is only applicable\nfor some endpoints; see specific endpoint documentation below.\n\n#### X-Limit\n\nThe page size can be controlled with the `X-Limit` header. Valid values are\n`1-100` and defaults to `100`.\n\n#### X-Next-Token\n\nIf the results are paginated, a response header of `X-Next-Token` will be\nreturned. Use the associated value in the subsequent request (via the `X-Next-Token`\nrequest header) to retrieve the next page. The following sequence diagram shows how to\nuse `X-Next-Token` to fetch all the records.\n\n<img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/climate-com/images/svg_upload_tests/x-next-token.svg\">\n\n\n## Chunked Uploads\n\nUploads larger than `5MiB` (`5242880 bytes`) must be done in `5MiB` chunks\n(with the exception of the final chunk). Each chunk request MUST contain a\n`Content-Range` header specifying the portion of the upload, and a `Content-Type`\nheader specifying binary content type (`application/octet-stream`). Range\nuploads must be contiguous. The maximum upload size is capped at `500MiB` (`524288000 bytes`).\n\n## Chunked Downloads\n\nDownloads larger than `5MiB` (`5242880 bytes`) must be done in `1-5MiB`\nchunks (with the exception of the final chunk, which may be less than `1MiB`).\nEach chunk request MUST contain a `Range` header specifying the requested portion of the download,\nand an `Accept` header specifying binary and json content types  (`application/octet-stream,application/json`)\nor all content types (`*/*`).\n\n## Drivers\n\nIf you need drivers to process agronomic data, download the ADAPT plugin below. We only support the plugin in the Windows environment, minimum is Windows 7 SP1.\n\nFor asPlanted, asHarvested and asApplied data:\n* [ADAPT Plugin](https://dev.fieldview.com/drivers/ClimateADAPTPlugin_latest.exe)\n<br>Release notes can be found [here](https://dev.fieldview.com/drivers/adapt-release-notes.txt).\n<br>Download and use of the ADAPT plugin means that you agree to the EULA for use of the ADAPT plugin. \n<br>Please review the [EULA](https://dev.fieldview.com/EULA/ADAPT%20Plugin%20EULA-06-19.pdf) (last updated on June 6th, 2019) before download and use of the ADAPT plugin.\n<br>For more information, please refer to:\n  * [ADAPT Resources](https://adaptframework.org/)\n  * [ADAPT Overview](https://aggateway.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ADM/overview)\n  * [ADAPT FAQ](https://aggateway.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ADM/pages/165942474/ADAPT+Frequently-Asked+Questions+FAQ)\n  * [ADAPT Videos](https://adaptframework.org/adapt-videos/)\n\n## Sample Test Data\n\nSample agronomic data:\n* [asPlanted and asHarvested data](https://dev.fieldview.com/sample-agronomic-data/Planting_Harvesting_data_04_18_2018_21_46_18.zip)\n* [asApplied data set 1](https://dev.fieldview.com/sample-agronomic-data/as-applied-data1.zip)\n* [asApplied data set 2](https://dev.fieldview.com/sample-agronomic-data/as-applied-data2.zip)\n<br>To upload the sample data to your account, please follow the instructions in this [link](https://support.climate.com/kt#/kA02A000000AaxzSAC/en_US).\n\nSample soil data:\n* [Sample soil data](https://dev.fieldview.com/sample-soil-data/soil-sample.xml)\n---\n",

      "description": "# Introduction\n\nThis API allows resellers to manage their resources in a simple, programmatic way using HTTP requests.\n\n# Conventions\n\n## Requests\n \nThe API supports different methods depending on the required action.\n\n| Method\t | Description\n| ---\t\t| ---\n| GET\t\t| Retrieve resources in a collection or get a single resource.<br/>Getters will never have any effect on the queried resources.\n | POST\t\t| Create a new resource in a collection.\n| PUT\t\t| Update an existing resource with its new representation.\n| DELETE\t| Delete an existing resource.\n \n## HTTP status codes\n\nThe API will reply with different HTTP statuscodes:\n \n| StatusCode\t\t\t\t| Description\n| ---\t\t\t\t\t\t| ---\n| 200 OK\t\t\t\t\t | The requests was processed and you receive data as a result.\n| 201 CREATED\t \t\t\t| The resource has been created. Either the Location header contains a link to the created resource, or links are being returned in the response body. The applied method will be indicated in the documentation.\n| 202 ACCEPTED\t\t\t\t | The request has been validated and accepted. Because we need to do some background processing prior to returning the result, we cannot send back a useful representation.\n | 204 NOCONTENT\t\t\t\t| The request has been processed, but no details can be returned.\n| 400 BADREQUEST\t\t\t| Your request is malformed.\n| 401 UNAUTHORIZED\t \t\t| You are not authorized. Follow the instructions in the Authorization documentation.\n | 403 FORBIDDEN\t\t\t\t| Access to the resource or operation is not allowed.\n | 404 NOTFOUND\t\t\t\t| The resource cannot be found.\n| 410 GONE                  | The resource is permanently no longer available.\n| 429 TOOMANYREQUESTS\t \t| The ratelimit has been exceeded. Please refer to the documentation on rate limiting for more details.\n| 500 INTERNALSERVERERROR\t| An error occurred during the processing of the request. The error is unexpected and most likely due to a bug in the api.\n\nIn the event of a problem, the body of the response will usually contain an errorcode and errormessage.\nIn rare cases additional details about the error are reported.\n\nErrorcodes 400-499 are considered to be client errors and indicate that there was an issue with the request.\nWe will not take any action besides monitoring. \n\nErrorcodes 500-599 are considered to be server errors. The errors are monitored AND action will be taken to resolve the error.\n \n## Formatting\n\nSnake casing is applied on resources and query parameters.\n The API is strictly returning JSON. No other formats are supported.\n\nDatetimes are returned in ISO-8601 format.\n\n## Pagination\n\nPagination is on by default on collections and is controlled by specifying *skip* and *take* parameters.  \n**Skip** indicates the number of results to skip and where to start the new take.  \n**Take** indicates the number of records to return. The returned number of items can be smaller than the requested take.\n\nPaged results will have headers with useful information regarding the paging.\n\n| Header\t\t\t\t| Description\n | ---\t\t\t\t\t| ---\n| X-Paging-Skipped\t\t| The number of results that have been skipped.\n| X-Paging-Take\t\t\t| The number of items in the current take. The number might differ from the requested take. It represents the actual number of items returned in the response.\n| X-Paging-TotalResults | The total number of results regardless of paging.\n\n## Rate limiting\n\nThe number of requests per interval is limited. Detailed information on the rate limiting can be found in specific headers which will be sent on each request.\n\n| Header\t\t\t\t| Description\n | ---\t\t\t\t\t| ---\n| X-RateLimit-Limit\t\t| The number of requests that can be made in a specific time interval.\n| X-RateLimit-Usage\t\t| The number of requests already made in the current time interval.\n| X-RateLimit-Remaining\t| The number of requests remaining until the reset.\n| X-RateLimit-Reset\t\t| The number of seconds until the reset.<br />After the reset you are allowed to make as many requests as specified by the X-RateLimit-Limit header.\n| Retry-After\t\t\t| The number of seconds you have to wait until you can make new requests.<br />This header is only present when the rate limit has been reached. It is identical to X-RateLimit-Reset.\n\nWhen the ratelimit has been reached, all requests will return with a HTTP statuscode 429 and ReasonPhrase '*Too many requests, retry later.*'.\n \n# Authentication\n\nThe Api uses HMAC authentication.  \nHash-based message authentication code (HMAC) is a mechanism for calculating a message authentication code involving a hash function in combination with a secret key.  \nBoth the integrity and the authenticity of the message are verified this way.\n\n## Steps to generate the HMAC\n\n1. Get your api key and secret from your controlpanel.  \nIt is absolutely vital that the secret is never exposed. Once the secret is out, anyone would be able to generate hmacs to impersonate you.  \nIn case your secret is compromised, you can generate a new api key and secret on your controlpanel.\n2. Construct the input value for generating the hmac.  \nConcatenate:apikey, request method, path and querystring information, unix timestamp, nonce and content.\n\n|\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t| Description\n| ---\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| ---\n| apikey\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t| The key that is linked to your user.\n| request method\t\t\t\t\t\t| lowercased (eg: get, post, delete,...)\n| path and querystring information\t\t| urlencoding of the lowercased relative path and querystring.<br />The path **MUST start with the api version (/v2)**.<br />The hexadecimal codes (percent encoding) MUST be uppercased.\n| unix timestamp\t\t\t\t\t\t| the unix timestamp in **seconds**.\n | nonce\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| a\tunique string for each request. It should be a random string, not related to the request. The nonce (in combination with the unix timestamp) protects you from replay attacks in case anyone was able to intercept a request.\n | content\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| When the request body is not empty, this should be the Base64 encoded Md5 hash of the request body.<br />An empty body should not be encoded.\n\n3. Hash the concatenated string using your api secret and the SHA-256 algorithm.\n4. Base64 encode the result of the hash function. This is the hmac signature you will need to send an authorized request.\n\n## Sending an authorized request\n\nAn authorized request can be made by sending the generated HMAC in the authorization header.  \nA correct authorizationheader uses the hmac authorization scheme and a correctly formatted authorization parameter.\n\nCreate the authorization parameter by concatenating:\n  * apikey\n  * colon ':'\n  * generated HMAC signature (see above)\n  * colon ':'\n  * nonce (the one used to generate the signature)\n  * colon ':'\n  * unix timestamp (the one used to generate the signature)\n\n A sample (illustrated):\n\n* The first line is the string you create to feed to the hashing algorithm.\n* The second line is the authorization header that should be sent in the request.\n\n![hmac authorization header illustrated](/v2/images/authentication_illustration.jpg \"authorization header illustrated\")\n\n## IP whitelisting\n\nAccess is by default restricted for all IP addresses. You need to explicitly whitelist an IP or an IP range in your controlpanel.\n\n# Versioning\n\nBecause of breaking contract changes compared to v1, we released v2 of the API.  \nV1 will still be available, but you are strongly encouraged to migrate to the latest version.  \nNew features will only be available on v2.\n\n# Policy\n\n### Fair use policy\n\nPlease respect the rate limits and do not use the api for any purposes of abuse.  \nAll requests are being monitored and logged.  \nIntentional abuse might result in api key revocation.\n \n# Errors\n\nThe API attempts to return appropriate HTTP status codes for every request.  \nWhen the status code indicates failure, the API will also provide an error message in most cases.\n\nAn error message contains a machine-parseable error code accompanied by a descriptive error text.  \nThe text for an error message might change over time, but codes will stay the same.\n\n[An overview of error codes can be found here](/v2/documentation/errorcodes).\n\n# Change log\n\n[An overview of new changes can be found here](/v2/documentation/changelog).\n\n# Provisioning information\n\n## Terminology\n\n| Term\t\t\t| Definition\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| ---\t\t\t| ---\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n| Servicepack\t| Defines a set of assets that belong together. An example is a hosting package which offers Linux hosting, a domain name, a couple of mailboxes and databases.<br/>It also limits the size of individual assets within the same account. |\n| Account\t\t| Represents an instance of the servicepack. It contains one or more assets. The number and size of assets is defined by the servicepack. |\n| Asset\t\t\t| A manageable service. For example: a mysql database, a linux hosting, a mailbox,...<br/>Some assets are created at the moment when the account is created. Other assets can be created afterwards.\n\t\n## Common provisioning scenario\n\n**Provisioning of an account with Linux hosting with one MySql database**\n \n*Without a pre-existing account:*\n\n1. Create a new account.<br/>Perform a POST on the accounts route and provide the desired servicepack id and identifier (domain name).\n2. Read the Location header from the response and perform a GET of the provided resource (a provisioning job).\n3. When the response returns 200(OK), you should repeat the GET operation after a certain interval (Repeat this step).<br/>\n When the response returns 201(Created), you should read the response body. This will contain links to the created resources.<br/>\nThis will usually hold only one link, but to be futureproof, this has been designed to return a collection.\n 4. The created resource will point to an account. You now know the account's Id and can continue with the provisioning of a MySql database on this account.\n 5. Perform a POST on the mysqldatabases route and provide the account id along with other requested information.\n6. Read the Location header from the response and perform a GET of the provided resource (a provisioning job).\n7. When the response returns 200(OK), you should repeat the GET operation after a certain interval (Repeat this step).<br/>\nWhen the response returns 201(Created), you should read the response body. This will contain links to the created resources.<br/>\n This will usually hold only one link, but to be futureproof, this has been designed to return a collection.\n8. The created resource will point to a MySql database resource.\n\n## SSL certificate requests\n\n**Requesting an SSL certificate causes the purchase of a paying product.**\n\n1. A certificate is created by adding an ssl certificate request.\n2. Upon statuscode 201 you should query for certificate completion on the resource provided in the location response header.\n3. The resource request can respond with different statuscodes:\n<ul>\n    <li>200: the certificate request is ongoing.<br/>\nCheck the validations collection for validation values that are not auto_validated. Those should be set by you system.<br/>\nCall verify domain validations once all validation values are in place. It might take some time for verification to take place. It is not necessary to call this method more than once.</li>\n    <li>303: the certificate request is complete; there is no more certificate request resource available. Check the location header value to retrieve the representation of the resulting ssl certificate.</li>\n    <li>410: the certificate request does not exist anymore, there is no certificate created as a result of the request.</li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "The PeerTube API is built on HTTP(S) and is RESTful. You can use your favorite\nHTTP/REST library for your programming language to use PeerTube. The spec API is fully compatible with\n[openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/wiki/API-client-generator-HOWTO)\n which generates a client SDK in the language of your choice - we generate some client SDKs automatically:\n\n- [Python](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/python)\n - [Go](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/go)\n- [Kotlin](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/kotlin)\n \nSee the [REST API quick start](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-getting-started) for a few\nexamples of using the PeerTube API.\n\n# Authentication\n\nWhen you sign up for an account on a PeerTube instance, you are given the possibility\n to generate sessions on it, and authenticate there using an access token. Only __one\naccess token can currently be used at a time__.\n\n## Roles\n\nAccounts are given permissions based on their role. There are three roles on\nPeerTube: Administrator, Moderator, and User. See the [roles guide](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/admin/managing-users#roles) for a detail of their permissions.\n\n# Errors\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure\nof the API call, completed by a [RFC7807-compliant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) response body.\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 404 Not Found\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Video not found\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"status\": 404,\n  \"title\": \"Not Found\",\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\"\n}\n```\n\nWe provide error `type` (following RFC7807) and `code` (internal PeerTube code) values for [a growing number of cases](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/develop/packages/models/src/server/server-error-code.enum.ts),\n but it is still optional. Types are used to disambiguate errors that bear the same status code\nand are non-obvious:\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 403 Forbidden\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Cannot get this video regarding follow constraints\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"status\": 403,\n  \"title\": \"Forbidden\",\n  \"type\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#section/Errors/does_not_respect_follow_constraints\"\n}\n```\n\nHere a 403 error could otherwise mean that the video is private or blocklisted.\n\n### Validation errors\n\nEach parameter is evaluated on its own against a set of rules before the route validator\nproceeds with potential testing involving parameter combinations. Errors coming from validation\nerrors appear earlier and benefit from a more detailed error description:\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Incorrect request parameters: id\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"instance\": \"/api/v1/videos/9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180\",\n  \"invalid-params\": {\n    \"id\": {\n      \"location\": \"params\",\n      \"msg\": \"Invalid value\",\n      \"param\": \"id\",\n      \"value\": \"9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"status\": 400,\n  \"title\": \"Bad Request\",\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `id` is the name of the field concerned by the error, within the route definition.\n`invalid-params.<field>.location` can be either 'params', 'body', 'header', 'query' or 'cookies', and\n`invalid-params.<field>.value` reports the value that didn't pass validation whose `invalid-params.<field>.msg`\n is about.\n\n### Deprecated error fields\n\nSome fields could be included with previous versions. They are still included but their use is deprecated:\n- `error`: superseded by `detail`\n\n# Rate limits\n\nWe are rate-limiting all endpoints of PeerTube's API. Custom values can be set by administrators:\n\n| Endpoint (prefix: `/api/v1`) | Calls         | Time frame   |\n|------------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n | `/*`                         | 50            | 10 seconds   |\n| `POST /users/token`          | 15            | 5 minutes    |\n| `POST /users/register`       | 2<sup>*</sup> | 5 minutes    |\n| `POST /users/ask-send-verify-email` | 3      | 5 minutes    |\n\nDepending on the endpoint, <sup>*</sup>failed requests are not taken into account. A service\nlimit is announced by a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.\n\nYou can get details about the current state of your rate limit by reading the\nfollowing headers:\n\n| Header                  | Description                                                |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n | `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | Number of max requests allowed in the current time period  |\n| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Number of remaining requests in the current time period    |\n| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | Timestamp of end of current time period as UNIX timestamp  |\n| `Retry-After`           | Seconds to delay after the first `429` is received         |\n\n# CORS\n\nThis API features [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/),\nallowing cross-domain communication from the browser for some routes:\n\n| Endpoint                    |\n|------------------------- ---|\n| `/api/*`                    |\n| `/download/*`               |\n| `/lazy-static/*`            |\n| `/.well-known/webfinger`    |\n\nIn addition, all routes serving ActivityPub are CORS-enabled for all origins.\n",

For example\nthe URL `/categories` serves a list of categories, the `/categories.json` API provides the\nsame information in JSON format.\n\nInstead of sending API requests to `/categories.json` you may also send them to `/categories`\nand add an `Accept: application/json` header to the request to get the JSON response.\nSending requests with the `Accept` header is necessary if you want to use URLs\nfor related endpoints returned by the API, such as pagination URLs.\nThese URLs are returned without the `.json` prefix so you need to add the header in\norder to get the correct response format.\n\n### Authentication\n\nSome endpoints do not require any authentication, pretty much anything else will\nrequire you to be authenticated.\n\nTo become authenticated you will need to create an API Key from the admin panel.\n\nOnce you have your API Key you can pass it in along with your API Username\nas an HTTP header like this:\n\n```\ncurl -X GET \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin/users/list/active.json\" \\\n-H \"Api-Key: 714552c6148e1617aeab526d0606184b94a80ec048fc09894ff1a72b740c5f19\" \\\n-H \"Api-Username: system\"\n```\n\nand this is how POST requests will look:\n \n```\ncurl -X POST \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/categories\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data;\" \\\n-H \"Api-Key: 714552c6148e1617aeab526d0606184b94a80ec048fc09894ff1a72b740c5f19\" \\\n-H \"Api-Username: system\" \\\n-F \"name=89853c20-4409-e91a-a8ea-f6cdff96aaaa\" \\\n-F \"color=49d9e9\" \\\n-F \"text_color=f0fcfd\"\n```\n\n### Boolean values\n \nIf an endpoint accepts a boolean be sure to specify it as a lowercase\n`true` or `false` value unless noted otherwise.\n",

      "description": "The Engine API is an HTTP API served by Docker Engine. It is the API the Docker client uses to communicate with the Engine, so everything the Docker client can do can be done with the API.\n\nMost of the client's commands map directly to API endpoints (e.g. `docker ps` is `GET /containers/json`). The notable exception is running containers, which consists of several API calls.\n\n# Errors\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"message\": \"page not found\"\n}\n```\n\n# Versioning\n\nThe API is usually changed in each release of Docker, so API calls are versioned to ensure that clients don't break.\n\nFor Docker Engine 17.09, the API version is 1.32. To lock to this version, you prefix the URL with `/v1.32`. For example, calling `/info` is the same as calling `/v1.32/info`.\n\nEngine releases in the near future should support this version of the API, so your client will continue to work even if it is talking to a newer Engine.\n\nIn previous versions of Docker, it was possible to access the API without providing a version. This behaviour is now deprecated will be removed in a future version of Docker.\n\nThe API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional properties in responses to ensure they do not break when talking to newer Docker daemons.\n\nThis documentation is for version 1.33 of the API. Use this table to find documentation for previous versions of the API:\n\nDocker version  | API version | Changes\n----------------|-------------|---------\n17.09.x | [1.31](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.32/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-32-api-changes)\n17.07.x | [1.31](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.31/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-31-api-changes)\n17.06.x | [1.30](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.30/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-30-api-changes)\n17.05.x | [1.29](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.29/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-29-api-changes)\n17.04.x | [1.28](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.28/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-28-api-changes)\n17.03.1 | [1.27](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.27/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-27-api-changes)\n1.13.1 & 17.03.0 | [1.26](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.26/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-26-api-changes)\n1.13.0 | [1.25](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.25/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-25-api-changes)\n1.12.x | [1.24](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.24/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-24-api-changes)\n1.11.x | [1.23](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-23-api-changes)\n1.10.x | [1.22](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.22/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-22-api-changes)\n1.9.x | [1.21](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.21/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-21-api-changes)\n1.8.x | [1.20](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.20/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-20-api-changes)\n1.7.x | [1.19](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.19/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-19-api-changes)\n1.6.x | [1.18](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.18/) | [API changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/version-history/#v1-18-api-changes)\n\n# Authentication\n\nAuthentication for registries is handled client side. The client has to send authentication details to various endpoints that need to communicate with registries, such as `POST /images/(name)/push`. These are sent as `X-Registry-Auth` header as a Base64 encoded (JSON) string with the following structure:\n\n```\n{\n  \"username\": \"string\",\n  \"password\": \"string\",\n  \"email\": \"string\",\n  \"serveraddress\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `serveraddress` is a domain/IP without a protocol. Throughout this structure, double quotes are required.\n\nIf you have already got an identity token from the [`/auth` endpoint](#operation/SystemAuth), you can just pass this instead of credentials:\n\n```\n{\n  \"identitytoken\": \"9cbaf023786cd7...\"\n}\n```\n",

These endpoints help the user to find data of interest using different parameters provided by the API endpoint.\nFor example,\nhttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/crossbar/proteins?accession=A0A023GRW5 -> will provide protein information about accession 'A0A023GRW5' including its interactions, functions, cross-references, variations and more.\nhttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/crossbar/activities?moleculeChemblId=CHEMBL465983 -> will provide ChEMBL bio-interactions related information including targets and bio-activity measurements associated with molecule chembl id 'CHEMBL465983'\n\n**Knowledge graphs**\nAnother use case of CROssBAR's API endpoints is in building knowledge graphs. These endpoints can be *weaved* together (output from one API endpoint fed as input to another API endpoint) programmatically to link nodes like protein, disease, drugs etc. as nodes of the graph. The endpoints are designed to be independent from each other which allows users the flexibility to drive biological networks from any facet e.g drug-centric, disease-centric, gene-centric etc. Our service for knowledge graph construction is available at https://crossbar.kansil.org.\nAn example for the part of the background queries on the CROssBAR API during the construction of a knowledge graph, \n(with the aim of keeping the example simple, we have only included the processes related to pathways, genes/proteins and drugs/compounds)\nIn this example, we would like to find bio-active compounds (with a pChEMBL value threshold of at least 6.0) & drugs targeting all proteins belonging to \"WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking\" pathway (based on Reactome pathway annotations).\nThis can be achieved by using endpoints listed on this swagger documentation as illustrated in following steps-\nFind bio-active compounds (with a pChEMBL value threshold of at least 6.0) & drugs targeting all proteins belonging to \"WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking\" pathway (based on Reactome annotations)\nThis can be achieved by using endpoints listed on [this swagger documentation](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/crossbar/swagger-ui.html) as illustrated in following steps-\n1. Get all proteins from “/proteins” API endpoint which have a reactome pathway name equal to \"WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking\".\n2. From the collection of uniprot protein accessions collected from step 1 above, we query “/targets” API endpoint to obtain the ‘target_chembl_id’s of these proteins.\n3. From the collection of target_chembl_ids collected from step 2 above, we query “/activities” API endpoint with pChEMBL value >=6, to obtain the ’molecule_chembl_id’s of the molecules that we need. \n4. From the collection of uniprot protein accessions collected from step 1 above, we find out Drug names and ids from the “/drugs” API endpoint that targets our proteins.\n5. From the collection of ’molecule_chembl_id’s obtained in step3, we query “/molecules” endpoint to get the compounds that are interacting with the genes/proteins belonging to the “WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking” pathway.",

      "description": "Welcome to our current iteration of our REST API. While we encourage you to upgrade to v2.0 we will continue support for our [SOAP API](https://github.com/fulfillment/soap-integration).\n \n# Versioning\n\nThe Fulfillment.com (FDC) REST API is version controlled and backwards compatible. We have many future APIs scheduled for publication within our v2.0 spec so please be prepared for us to add data nodes in our responses, however, we will not remove knowledge from previously published APIs.\n\n#### A Current Response\n\n```javascript\n{\n  id: 123\n}\n```\n\n#### A Potential Future Response\n\n```javascript\n{\n  id: 123,\n  reason: \"More Knowledge\"\n }\n```\n\n# Getting Started\n\nWe use OAuth v2.0 to authenticate clients, you can choose [implicit](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/) or [password](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/password/) grant type. To obtain an OAuth `client_id` and `client_secret` contact your account executive.\n\n**Tip**: Generate an additional login and use those credentials for your integration so that changes are accredited to that \"user\".\n\nYou are now ready to make requests to our other APIs by filling your `Authorization` header with `Bearer {access_token}`.\n\n## Perpetuating Access\n\nPerpetuating access to FDC without storing your password locally can be achieved using the `refresh_token` returned by [POST /oauth/access_token](#operation/generateToken).\n\nA simple concept to achieve this is outlined below.\n\n1. Your application/script will ask you for your `username` and `password`, your `client_id` and `client_secret` will be accessible via a DB or ENV.\n2. [Request an access_token](#operation/generateToken)\n  + Your function should be capable of formatting your request for both a `grant_type` of \\\"password\\\" (step 1) and \\\"refresh_token\\\" (step 4).\n3. Store the `access_token` and `refresh_token` so future requests can skip step 1\n4. When the `access_token` expires request anew using your `refresh_token`, replace both tokens in local storage.\n\n+ If this fails you will have to revert to step 1.\n \nAlternatively if you choose for your application/script to have access to your `username` and `password` you can skip step 4.\n\nIn all scenarios we recommend storing all credentials outside your codebase.\n\n## Date Time Definitions\n\n We will report all date-time stamps using the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard. When using listing APIs where fromDate and toDate are available note that both dates are inclusive while requiring the fromDate to be before or at the toDate.\n\n### The Fulfillment Process\n\nMany steps are required to fulfill your order we report back to you three fundamental milestones inside the orders model.\n\n* `recordedOn` When we received your order. This will never change.\n \n* `dispatchDate` When the current iteration of your order was scheduled for fulfillment. This may change however it is an indicator that the physical process of fulfillment has begun and a tracking number has been **assigned** to your order. The tracking number **MAY CHANGE**. You will not be able to cancel an order once it has been dispatched. If you need to recall an order that has been dispatched please contact your account executive.\n\n* `departDate` When we recorded your order passing our final inspection and placed with the carrier. At this point it is **safe to inform the consignee** of the tracking number as it will not change.\n \n## Evaluating Error Responses\n\nWe currently return two different error models, with and without context. All errors will include a `message` node while errors with `context` will include additional information designed to save you time when encountering highly probable errors. For example, when you send us a request to create a duplicate order, we will reject your request and the context will include the FDC order `id` so that you may record it for your records.\n\n### Without Context\n\nNew order with missing required fields.\n\n| Header | Response |\n | ------ | -------- |\n| Status | `400 Bad Request` |\n\n```javascript\n{    \n  \"message\": \"Invalid request body\"\n}\n```\n\n### With Context\n\nNew order with duplicate `merchantOrderId`.\n\n| Header | Response |\n| ------ | -------- |\n| Status | `409 Conflict` |\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"message\": \"Duplicate Order\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"id\": 123\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Status Codes\n\n Codes are a concatenation of State, Stage, and Detail.\n\n`^([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})$`\n \n| Code | State              | Stage    | Detail         |\n| ---- | ------------------ | -------- | -------------- |\n| 010101 | Processing Order | Received | Customer Order |\n| 010102 | Processing Order | Received | Received |\n| 010201 | Processing Order | Approved | |\n| 010301 | Processing Order | Hold | Merchant Stock |\n | 010302 | Processing Order | Hold | Merchant Funds |\n| 010303 | Processing Order | Hold | For Merchant |\n| 010304 | Processing Order | Hold | Oversized Shipment |\n| 010305 | Processing Order | Hold | Invalid Parent Order |\n| 010306 | Processing Order | Hold | Invalid Address |\n| 010307 | Processing Order | Hold | By Admin |\n| 010401 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Incomplete Address |\n| 010402 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Invalid Locality |\n| 010403 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Invalid Region |\n| 010404 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Address Not Found |\n| 010405 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Many Addresses Found |\n| 010406 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Invalid Postal Code |\n| 010407 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Country Not Mapped |\n| 010408 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Invalid Recipient Name |\n | 010409 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Bad UK Address |\n| 010410 | Processing Order | Address Problem | Invalid Address Line 1 or 2 |\n| 010501 | Processing Order | Sku Problem | Invalid SKU |\n| 010501 | Processing Order | Sku Problem | Child Order has Invalid SKUs |\n| 010601 | Processing Order | Facility Problem | Facility Not Mapped |\n| 010701 | Processing Order | Ship Method Problem | Unmapped Ship Method |\n| 010702 | Processing Order | Ship Method Problem | Unmapped Ship Cost |\n| 010703 | Processing Order | Ship Method Problem | Missing Ship Method |\n| 010704 | Processing Order | Ship Method Problem | Invalid Ship Method |\n | 010705 | Processing Order | Ship Method Problem | Order Weight Outside of Ship Method Weight |\n| 010801 | Processing Order | Inventory Problem | Insufficient Inventory In Facility |\n| 010802 | Processing Order | Inventory Problem | Issue Encountered During Inventory Adjustment |\n| 010901 | Processing Order | Released To WMS | Released |\n| 020101 | Fulfillment In Progress | Postage Problem | Address Issue |\n| 020102 | Fulfillment In Progress | Postage Problem | Postage OK, OMS Issue Occurred |\n| 020103 | Fulfillment In Progress | Postage Problem | Postage Void Failed |\n| 020201 | Fulfillment In Progress | Postage Acquired | |\n| 020301 | Fulfillment In Progress | Postage Voided | Postage Void Failed Gracefully |\n | 020301 | Fulfillment In Progress | Hold | Departure Hold Requested |\n| 020401 | Fulfillment In Progress | 4PL Processing | |\n| 020501 | Fulfillment In Progress | 4PL Problem | Order is Proccessable, Postage Issue Occurred |\n| 020601 | Fulfillment In Progress | Label Printed | |\n| 020701 | Fulfillment In Progress | Shipment Cubed | |\n| 020801 | Fulfillment In Progress | Picking Inventory | |\n| 020901 | Fulfillment In Progress | Label Print Verified | |\n| 021001 | Fulfillment In Progress | Passed Final Inspection | |\n| 030101 | Shipped | Fulfilled By 4PL | |\n| 030102 | Shipped | Fulfilled By 4PL | Successfully Fulfilled, OMS Encountered Issue During Processing |\n| 030201 | Shipped | Fulfilled By FDC | |\n| 040101 | Returned | Returned | |\n| 050101 | Cancelled | Cancelled | |\n| 060101 | Test | Test | Test |\n",

      "name": "Postman API",
      "description": "The Postman API allows you to programmatically access data stored in Postman account with ease.\n\nThe easiest way to get started with the API is to click the **fork** button to fork this collection to your own workspace and use Postman to send requests.\n\n\n# Overview\n\n1. You need a valid <a href=\"#authentication\">API Key</a> to send requests to the API endpoints. You can get your key from the [integrations dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys).\n\n1. The API has an access <a href=\"#rate-limits\">rate limit</a> applied to it.\n\n1. The Postman API will only respond to secured communication done over HTTPS. HTTP requests will be sent a `301` redirect to corresponding HTTPS resources.\n\n1. Response to every request is sent in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). In case the API request results in an error, it is represented by an `\"error\": {}` key in the JSON response.\n\n1. The request method (verb) determines the nature of action you intend to perform. A request made using the `GET` method implies that you want to fetch something from Postman, and `POST` implies you want to save something new to Postman.\n\n1. The API calls will respond with appropriate [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for all requests. Within Postman Client, when a response is received, the status code is highlighted and is accompanied by a help text that indicates the possible meaning of the response code. A `200 OK` indicates all went well, while `4XX` or `5XX` response codes indicate an error from the requesting client or our API servers respectively.\n\n1. Individual resources in your Postman Account is accessible using its unique id (`uid`). The `uid` is a simple concatenation of the resource owner's user-id and the resource-id. For example, a collection's `uid` is `{{owner_id}}-{{collection_id}}`.\n\n# Authentication\n\nAn API Key is required to be sent as part of every request to the Postman API, in the form of an `X-Api-Key` request header.\n\n> If you do not have an API Key, you can easily generate one by heading over to the [Postman Integrations Dashboard](https://go.postman.co/integrations/services/pm_pro_api).\n\nAn API Key tells our API server that the request it received came from you. Everything that you have access to in Postman is accessible with an API Key that is generated by you.\n\nFor ease of use inside Postman, you could store your API key in an [environment variable](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments) called `postman_api_key` and this [Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections) will automatically use it to make API calls.\n\n## API Key related error response\n\nIf an API Key is missing, malformed, or invalid, you will receive a `401 Unauthorised` response code and the following JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"error\": { \n    \"name\": \"AuthenticationError\",\n    \"message\": \"API Key missing. Every request requires an API Key to be sent.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Using the API Key as a query parameter\n\nEvery request that accepts API Key as `X-Api-Key` request header, also accepts the key when sent as `apikey` URL query parameter.\n\nAPI key sent as part of the header has a higher priority in case you send the key using both request header and query parameter.\n\n\n# Rate Limits\n\nAPI access rate limits are applied at a per-key basis in unit time. Access to the API using a key is limited to **60 requests per minute**. In addition, every API response is accompanied by the following set of headers to identify the status of your consumption.\n\n\n| Header                  | Description |\n|-------------------------|-------------|\n| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per minute. |\n| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |\n| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |\n\n\nOnce you hit the rate limit, you will receive a response similar to the following JSON, with a status code of `429 Too Many Requests`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"name\": \"rateLimitError\",\n    \"message\": \"Rate Limit exceeded. Please retry at 1465452702843\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n# Support\n\nFor help regarding accessing the Postman API, feel free to discuss it in our [Discourse Community](https://community.getpostman.com). You can also drop in a line at [help@getpostman.com](mailto:help@getpostman.com).\n\nIn the event you receive a `503` response from our servers, it implies that we have hit an unexpected spike in API access traffic and would usually be operational within the next 5 minutes. If the outage persists, or your receive any other form of `5XX` error, kindly let us know.\n\n\n# Terms of Use\n\nFor information on API terms of use and privacy, refer to our terms at [http://postman.com/legal/terms/](http://postman.com/legal/terms/) and our privacy policy at [https://www.postman.com/legal/privacy-policy/](https://www.postman.com/legal/privacy-policy/).\n\n\n# API Reference",

Because geocoding is nothing without data, it provides an easy to use importer that will automatically download and import the necessary (free) data to your local database ([OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) and [Quattroshapes](http://www.quattroshapes.com/): more than 100 million entries). You can also add your own data with the Web interface or the importer connectors provided. Gisgraphy is production ready, and has been designed to be scalable(load balanced), performant and used in other languages than just java : results can be output in XML, JSON, PHP, Python, Ruby, YAML, GeoRSS, and Atom. One of the most popular GPS tracking System (OpenGTS) also includes a Gisgraphy client...Gisgraphy is a framework.

Your requests must also use the <b>HTTPS</b> protocol.\n\nIf you don't have a token yet, you need to apply for one [here](https://www.globalwinescore.com/api/).\n\nYour personal token can be found under the <a href=\"https://www.globalwinescore.com/account/api/\" target=\"_blank\">My account > API</a> section of the GlobalWineScore website\n\n# Format\nThe API provides several rendering formats which you can control using the `Accept` header or `format` query parameter.\n\n- JSON (default): no header or `Accept: application/json`\n- XML: `Accept: application/xml`\n# Rate limiting\nFor API requests, the rate limit allows for up to 10 requests per minute.\n\n# Error handling\n\nWhether a request succeeded is indicated by the HTTP status code. A 2xx status code indicates success, whereas a 4xx status code indicates failure.\n\nWhen a request fails, the response body is still JSON, but always contains a `detail` field with a description of the error, which you can inspect for debugging.\n\nFor example, trying to access the API without proper authentication will return code 403 along with the message:\n\n`{\"detail\": \"Authentication credentials were not provided.\"}`\n\nFound a bug ? send us an email at <a href=\"mailto:api@globalwinescore.com\">api@globalwinescore.com</a>\n\n# Ordering\n\nAt the moment, GlobalWineScores may be sorted by `date` and `score`. Use \"-\"\nto sort in descending order.\n\n# Continuous synchronization\n\nIf you need to synchronize your database with our API, you can query our API using `?ordering=-date` to get the newest scores first, which means you won't have to crawl the whole catalog every time :-)\n\n# Quick search interface\nIf you need to search our catalog (e.g. to align it with yours), we're providing you with a handy interface accessible here: <a href=\"https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/</a>\n\nYou need to be logged in (email/password) to access this page, but other than that you can share it with anyone in your team and start searching right away !\n\n# Resources\n\nThe details about available endpoints can be found below.\nYou can click on each endpoint to find information about their parameters.\n",

      "description": "# Google Home Local API\nThis is an unofficial documentation of the local API used by the Home app to communicate with GH devices.\n[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi)\n \n[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi)](https://github.com/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi/stargazers) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi)](https://github.com/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\n \n## Getting Started\n\nRequests must be made over HTTPS, port 8443, so the base URL for these endpoints is: `https://<google-home-ip>:8443/setup/`\n\nGet the IP of Google Home from the Google Home app (Device Settings -> End of the list) or from your router.\n\nGET requests are simple, in the browser kind.  \nPOST requests need to set the header (when there's a body): `content-type: application/json`\n \n## Authentication\n\nSince June 2019, most requests (with exceptions like `/setup/eureka_info`) need a local authorization token.\n\nThere are 3 kinds of tokens involved here:\n \n### Local Authorization Token\nThis token must be sent in all requests in the header `cast-local-authorization-token`. It is short-lived (~1 day) and may change unexpectedly (with a sync, change in homegraph, etc.)\n##### Get this token\n - With access to an android device, [get this token directly by either method](https://gist.github.com/rithvikvibhu/1a0f4937af957ef6a78453e3be482c1f).\n - Without a device, or to integrate it with a script, use an access token to get the homegraph and extract the token. To get an access token, read the next section. Check the example section for more info.\n\n### Access Token\nThis is a standard google oauth2 access token. It is in the form `ya29.***`.\nThis gives access to the Google Home Foyer API. These expire in an hour.\nUse this to get the homegraph (and then the local authorization token above).\n##### Get this token\nTo get this access token, either a Google account username/password or a Google Master Token is needed. More info in the gist.\nUse the script [from this gist](https://gist.github.com/rithvikvibhu/952f83ea656c6782fbd0f1645059055d).\n \n### Master Token\nThis is in the form `aas_et/***` and can be used to request access tokens.\n##### Get this token\nThe same [script in the gist](https://gist.github.com/rithvikvibhu/952f83ea656c6782fbd0f1645059055d) that gets the access token can also get the master token. Needs Google account creds.\n\n## Example\n\nHere's the whole flow from just a pair of username/password to using the local API.\n\nPrerequisites:\n- [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl)\n - [Proto files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RvnN3y-G23pd2SWHmfV_7sef8QU5GNF4?usp=sharing) (preserve folder structure)\n\n### 1. Get an access token with the script\n- Download get_tokens.py\n- Fill in username and password\n```sh\npython3 get_tokens.py\n # Note down the access token printed.\n```\n\n### 2. Use the access token and get home graph\n- This prints the json and uses jq to parse and filter out the fields deviceName and localAuthToken\n- This will give a list of all devices and their local auth tokens\n```sh\n./grpcurl -H 'authorization: Bearer ya29.a0Af****' \\\n\t-import-path /path/to/protos \\\n\t-proto /path/to/protos/google/internal/home/foyer/v1.proto \\\n\tgooglehomefoyer-pa.googleapis.com:443 \\\n\tgoogle.internal.home.foyer.v1.StructuresService/GetHomeGraph | jq '.home.devices[] | {deviceName, localAuthToken}'\n# Note down the local auth token for the device you want.\n```\n\n### 3. Make the call to the local device using the local auth token\n```sh\ncurl -H \"cast-local-authorization-token: LOCAL_AUTH_TOKEN\" --verbose --insecure https://192.168.0.18:8443/setup/bluetooth/status\n```",

      "description": "This is the official documentation for the Hetzner Cloud API.\n\n ## Introduction\n\nThe Hetzner Cloud API operates over HTTPS and uses JSON as its data format. The API is a RESTful API and utilizes HTTP methods and HTTP status codes to specify requests and responses.\n\nAs an alternative to working directly with our API you may also consider to use:\n\n- Our CLI program [hcloud](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)\n - Our [library for Go](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-go)\n- Our [library for Python](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python)\n\nAlso you can find a [list of libraries, tools, and integrations on GitHub](https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud).\n \nIf you are developing integrations based on our API and your product is Open Source you may be eligible for a free one time € 50 / $ 50 (excl. VAT) credit on your account. Please contact us via the support page on your Cloud Console and let us know the following:\n\n- The type of integration you would like to develop\n- Link to the GitHub repo you will use for the Project\n- Link to some other Open Source work you have already done (if you have done so)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo get started using the API you first need an API token. Sign in into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token. Make sure to copy the token because it won’t be shown to you again. A token is bound to a Project, to interact with the API of another Project you have to create a new token inside the Project. Let’s say your new token is `LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj`.\n \nYou’re now ready to do your first request against the API. To get a list of all Servers in your Project, issue the example request on the right side using [curl](https://curl.se/).\n\nMake sure to replace the token in the example command with the token you have just created. Since your Project probably does not contain any Servers yet, the example response will look like the response on the right side. We will almost always provide a resource root like `servers` inside the example response. A response can also contain a `meta` object with information like [Pagination](#pagination).\n\n**Example Request**\n\n```shell\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj\" \\\n  https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers\n```\n\n**Example Response**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": [],\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"pagination\": {\n      \"page\": 1,\n      \"per_page\": 25,\n      \"previous_page\": null,\n      \"next_page\": null,\n      \"last_page\": 1,\n      \"total_entries\": 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Authentication\n\nAll requests to the Hetzner Cloud API must be authenticated via a API token. Include your secret API token in every request you send to the API with the `Authorization` HTTP header.\n\nTo create a new API token for your Project, switch into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token.\n \n**Example Authorization header**\n\n```http\nAuthorization: Bearer LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj\n ```\n\n## Errors\n\nErrors are indicated by HTTP status codes. Further, the response of the request which generated the error contains an error code, an error message, and, optionally, error details. The schema of the error details object depends on the error code.\n\nThe error response contains the following keys:\n\n| Keys      | Meaning                                                               |\n| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `code`    | Short string indicating the type of error (machine-parsable)          |\n| `message` | Textual description on what has gone wrong                            |\n| `details` | An object providing for details on the error (schema depends on code) |\n\n**Example response**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"invalid_input\",\n    \"message\": \"invalid input in field 'broken_field': is too long\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"broken_field\",\n          \"messages\": [\"is too long\"]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Error Codes\n\n| Code                      | Description                                                                      |\n| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `forbidden`               | Insufficient permissions for this request                                        |\n| `unauthorized`            | Request was made with an invalid or unknown token                                |\n| `invalid_input`           | Error while parsing or processing the input                                      |\n| `json_error`              | Invalid JSON input in your request                                               |\n| `locked`                  | The item you are trying to access is locked (there is already an Action running) |\n| `not_found`               | Entity not found                                                                 |\n| `rate_limit_exceeded`     | Error when sending too many requests                                             |\n| `resource_limit_exceeded` | Error when exceeding the maximum quantity of a resource for an account           |\n| `resource_unavailable`    | The requested resource is currently unavailable (e.g. not available for order)   |\n| `server_error`            | Error within the API backend                                                     |\n| `service_error`           | Error within a service                                                           |\n | `uniqueness_error`        | One or more of the objects fields must be unique                                 |\n| `protected`               | The Action you are trying to start is protected for this resource                |\n| `maintenance`             | Cannot perform operation due to maintenance                                      |\n| `conflict`                | The resource has changed during the request, please retry                        |\n| `unsupported_error`       | The corresponding resource does not support the Action                           |\n| `token_readonly`          | The token is only allowed to perform GET requests                                |\n| `unavailable`             | A service or product is currently not available                                  |\n| `deprecated_api_endpoint` | The request can not be answered because the API functionality was removed        |\n\n**invalid_input**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"invalid_input\",\n    \"message\": \"invalid input in field 'broken_field': is too long\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"fields\" : [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"broken_field\",\n          \"messages\" : [\"is too long\"]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**uniqueness_error**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"uniqueness_error\",\n    \"message\": \"SSH key with the same fingerprint already exists\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"public_key\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**resource_limit_exceeded**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"resource_limit_exceeded\",\n    \"message\": \"project limit exceeded\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"limits\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"project_limit\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**deprecated_api_endpoint**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"deprecated_api_endpoint\",\n    \"message\": \"API functionality was removed\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"announcement\": \"https://docs.hetzner.cloud/changelog#2023-07-20-foo-endpoint-is-deprecated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Labels\n\nLabels are `key/value` pairs that can be attached to all resources.\n\nValid label keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated by a slash (`/`). The name segment is required and must be a string of 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (`.`), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (`/`).\n\nValid label values must be a string of 63 characters or less and must be empty or begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between.\n\nThe `hetzner.cloud/` prefix is reserved and cannot be used.\n\n**Example Labels**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"labels\": {\n    \"environment\": \"development\",\n    \"service\": \"backend\",\n    \"example.com/my\": \"label\",\n    \"just-a-key\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Label Selector\n\nFor resources with labels, you can filter resources by their labels using the label selector query language.\n\n| Expression           | Meaning                                              |\n| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| `k==v` / `k=v`       | Value of key `k` does equal value `v`                |\n| `k!=v`               | Value of key `k` does not equal value `v`            |\n| `k`                  | Key `k` is present                                   |\n| `!k`                 | Key `k` is not present                               |\n| `k in (v1,v2,v3)`    | Value of key `k` is `v1`, `v2`, or `v3`              |\n| `k notin (v1,v2,v3)` | Value of key `k` is neither `v1`, nor `v2`, nor `v3` |\n| `k1==v,!k2`          | Value of key `k1` is `v` and key `k2` is not present |\n\n### Examples\n\n- Returns all resources that have a `env=production` label and that don't have a `type=database` label:\n\n  `env=production,type!=database`\n \n- Returns all resources that have a `env=testing` or `env=staging` label:\n\n  `env in (testing,staging)`\n\n- Returns all resources that don't have a `type` label:\n\n  `!type`\n\n## Pagination\n\nResponses which return multiple items support pagination. If they do support pagination, it can be controlled with following query string parameters:\n\n- A `page` parameter specifies the page to fetch. The number of the first page is 1.\n- A `per_page` parameter specifies the number of items returned per page. The default value is 25, the maximum value is 50 except otherwise specified in the documentation.\n\nResponses contain a `Link` header with pagination information.\n\nAdditionally, if the response body is JSON and the root object is an object, that object has a `pagination` object inside the `meta` object with pagination information:\n\n**Example Pagination**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"servers\": [...],\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"pagination\": {\n            \"page\": 2,\n            \"per_page\": 25,\n            \"previous_page\": 1,\n            \"next_page\": 3,\n            \"last_page\": 4,\n            \"total_entries\": 100\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe keys `previous_page`, `next_page`, `last_page`, and `total_entries` may be `null` when on the first page, last page, or when the total number of entries is unknown.\n\n**Example Pagination Link header**\n\n```http\nLink: <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=2&per_page=5>; rel=\"prev\",\n      <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=4&per_page=5>; rel=\"next\",\n      <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=6&per_page=5>; rel=\"last\"\n```\n\nLine breaks have been added for display purposes only and responses may only contain some of the above `rel` values.\n\n## Rate Limiting\n \nAll requests, whether they are authenticated or not, are subject to rate limiting. If you have reached your limit, your requests will be handled with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Burst requests are allowed. Responses contain serveral headers which provide information about your current rate limit status.\n\n- The `RateLimit-Limit` header contains the total number of requests you can perform per hour.\n- The `RateLimit-Remaining` header contains the number of requests remaining in the current rate limit time frame.\n- The `RateLimit-Reset` header contains a UNIX timestamp of the point in time when your rate limit will have recovered and you will have the full number of requests available again.\n\nThe default limit is 3600 requests per hour and per Project. The number of remaining requests increases gradually. For example, when your limit is 3600 requests per hour, the number of remaining requests will increase by 1 every second.\n\n## Server Metadata\n \nYour Server can discover metadata about itself by doing a HTTP request to specific URLs. The following data is available:\n\n| Data              | Format | Contents                                                     |\n| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| hostname          | text   | Name of the Server as set in the api                         |\n| instance-id       | number | ID of the server                                             |\n| public-ipv4       | text   | Primary public IPv4 address                                  |\n| private-networks  | yaml   | Details about the private networks the Server is attached to |\n| availability-zone | text   | Name of the availability zone that Server runs in            |\n| region            | text   | Network zone, e.g. eu-central                                |\n\n**Example: Summary**\n\n```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata\n ```\n\n```yaml\navailability-zone: hel1-dc2\nhostname: my-server\ninstance-id: 42\npublic-ipv4: 1.2.3.4\nregion: eu-central\n```\n\n**Example: Hostname**\n\n ```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/hostname\nmy-server\n ```\n\n**Example: Instance ID**\n\n```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/instance-id\n 42\n```\n\n**Example: Public IPv4**\n\n```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/public-ipv4\n 1.2.3.4\n```\n\n**Example: Private Networks**\n\n```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/private-networks\n ```\n\n```yaml\n- ip: 10.0.0.2\n  alias_ips: [10.0.0.3, 10.0.0.4]\n  interface_num: 1\n  mac_address: 86:00:00:2a:7d:e0\n  network_id: 1234\n  network_name: nw-test1\n  network: 10.0.0.0/8\n  subnet: 10.0.0.0/24\n  gateway: 10.0.0.1\n- ip: 192.168.0.2\n  alias_ips: []\n  interface_num: 2\n  mac_address: 86:00:00:2a:7d:e1\n  network_id: 4321\n  network_name: nw-test2\n  network: 192.168.0.0/16\n  subnet: 192.168.0.0/24\n  gateway: 192.168.0.1\n```\n\n**Example: Availability Zone**\n\n```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/availability-zone\nhel1-dc2\n ```\n\n**Example: Region**\n\n```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/region\n eu-central\n```\n\n## Sorting\n\nSome responses which return multiple items support sorting. If they do support sorting the documentation states which fields can be used for sorting. You specify sorting with the `sort` query string parameter. You can sort by multiple fields. You can set the sort direction by appending `:asc` or `:desc` to the field name. By default, ascending sorting is used.\n\n**Example: Sorting**\n\n```\nhttps://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status\nhttps://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc\n https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:desc\nhttps://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc&sort=command:desc\n ```\n\n## Deprecation Notices\n\nYou can find all announced deprecations in our [Changelog](/changelog).\n",

      "name": "Developer documentation",
      "description": "# Welcome\n\nImplementing a new tool can be daunting, but it doesn't have to. You can implement journy.io in a few different ways to ensure it fits with the rest of your tech stack seamlessly.\n\nWe welcome your feedback, ideas and suggestions. We really want to make your life easier, so if we’re falling short or should be doing something different, we want to hear about it. Send us an email at [hi@journy.io](mailto:hi@journy.io) or reach out via the chat on our website or on our platform.\n\nThere are multiple ways you can send us data about users and accounts. We have both frontend and backend APIs, which can be used together at the same time.\n\nIf you already use [Segment](https://segment.com/), you can [get up and running with journy.io in seconds](https://help.journy.io/en/articles/6488307-the-segment-connector).\n \n# Concepts\n\n## Users\n\nThe most basic entity is a user, a specific individual that completed an interaction with your product.\n\nWe support multiple types of users, often differentiated by it's external ID prefix. E.g. In the case you are building an ordering app, there could easily be an administrator (who updates products and checks for orders) and the end-customers who place orders. One could have a typical ADM-XXXXXXXX ID, while the other would be referenced by USR-XXXXXXXXX.\n \n## Accounts\n\nIn B2B SaaS, users can be part of multiple accounts. E.g. Imagine you're building a content scheduling app where an agency can manage the social media posts of their clients. Each client of the agency has its own account in the product.\n\nIf your app doesn't have the concept of a team or group of users, you can ignore accounts.\n\n## Events\n\nAn event is a data point that represents an interaction between a user and/or an account; and your product. Events can represents any range of interactions. E.g. Every time a customer creates an invoice in an invoicing app. Actions like creating an invoice can be tracked as an event in journy.io.\n\nIt's critical to track events properly. You'll need to provide either an account ID, or a user ID, or both; when tracking an event. E.g. If a user updates his personal settings, you can omit the account ID as the event would not be related to any account. In a same logic, an account could get a 'suspend account' event (with account ID) from an internal process, whereas no user would be associated. In most cases, events will be associated to both 1 user and 1 account.\n \nYou can optionally pass extra details as metadata (e.g. amount of the invoice). This gets particarly powerfull when creating computed properties on those event metadata. E.g. Our above ordering app could send journy.io 'Place Order' events with metadata 'price', on which journy.io very easily would compute a total order value (for each account) for the last 30 days.\n\n💡 Metadata does not update the properties of a user or account.\n\n# Frontend vs backend\n\nThe best implementations we see employ a hybrid approach to maximize data quality while maintaining the flexibility to easily collect the data they need.\n\nWe recommend using our JavaScript snippet to track screen views and our backend API to sync users, sync accounts and track events.\n\nWhen evaluating how to track a particular event, we suggest starting with server-side and only use frontend if it's not possible to collect purely server-side. This can be the case if you need to track interactions with your product that don't result in any natural server requests (such as a button click that opens a modal).\n\n# Frontend\n\n## Setup\n\n💡 You can find the JavaScript snippet in the website settings in the connections view.\n\nCopy the JavaScript snippet and place it in the head or body of your application.\n\nThe snippet automatically calls `journy(\"init\", { ... })` and `journy(\"pageview\")`.\n\n## Identify user\n \n💡 A user ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize a user by in your own systems. Because these IDs are consistent across a customer’s lifetime, you should include a user ID in identify calls as often as you can. Ideally, the user ID should be a database ID.\n\n💡 journy.io does not recommend using simple email addresses or usernames as user ID, as these can change over time. journy.io recommends that you use static IDs instead, so the IDs never change. When you use a static ID, you can still recognize the user in your analytics tools, even if the user changes their email address.\n\n💡 The properties `full_name`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone` and `registered_at` will be used for creating contacts in destinations like Intercom, HubSpot, Salesforce, ...\n\n`journy(\"identify\")` allows you to identify the user that is currently using your product.\n\n```ts\njourny(\"identify\", {\n  // Email or user ID is required\n  email: \"john.doe@acme.com\",\n  // Unique identifier for the user in your database\n  userId: \"20\",\n\n  // Optional\n  // Hash of the user ID using a backend secret\n  // You can find the secret in the website settings\n  // Recommended to prevent spoofing\n  verification: \"hash\",\n\n  // Optional\n  properties: {\n    full_name: \"John Doe\",\n    // or\n    first_name: \"John\",\n    last_name: \"Doe\",\n\n    phone: \"123\",\n    registered_at: new Date(/* ... */),\n    is_admin: true,\n    key_with_empty_value: \"\",\n    this_property_will_be_deleted: null,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Identify account\n\n💡 An account ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize an account by in your own systems. Ideally, the account ID should be a database ID.\n\n💡 The properties `name`, `mrr`, `plan` and `registered_at` will be used to create companies in destinations like Intercom, HubSpot, Salesforce, ...\n\n`journy(\"account\")` allows you to identify the business account (i.e. organization) using your product.\n\n```ts\njourny(\"account\", {\n  // Required\n  // Unique identifier for the account in your database\n  accountId: \"30\",\n\n  // Optional\n  // Hash of the account ID using a backend secret\n  // You can find the secret in the website settings\n  // Recommended to prevent spoofing\n  verification: \"hash\",\n\n  // Optional\n  properties: {\n    name: \"ACME, Inc\",\n    mrr: 399,\n    plan: \"Pro\",\n    registered_at: new Date(/* ... */),\n    is_paying: true,\n    key_with_empty_value: \"\",\n    this_property_will_be_deleted: null,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Send page view\n \n💡 In applications, we advise you to use screen views instead of page views.\n \nThe JavaScript snippet in the site settings includes a `pageview` by default.\n\n```ts\njourny(\"pageview\");\n```\n\nIf you have a B2B application, we recommend to set account ID for every page view that happens within the context of an account.\n \n💡 An account ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize an account by in your own systems. Ideally, the account ID should be a database ID.\n\n```ts\njourny(\"pageview\", {\n  accountId: \"30\",\n\n  // Optional\n  // Hash of the account ID using a backend secret\n  // You can find the secret in the website settings\n  // Recommended to prevent spoofing\n  verification: \"hash\",\n});\n```\n\n## Send screen view\n\nIn applications, we strongly advise you to use screen views instead of page views.\n\nPage URLs in applications often include the account ID (e.g. https://app.acme.com/accountId/settings).\n\nThis makes it difficult to create signals, segments, ... based on those URLs.\n\nThat's what screen views solve. It allows you to set a name for the screen being viewed (e.g. Account settings).\n\n```ts\njourny(\"screen\", { name: \"Personal settings\" });\n```\n\nIf you have a B2B application, we recommend to set account ID for every screen view that happens within the context of an account.\n\nExample: \"Personal settings\" would be without account ID, \"Team settings\" would be with account ID.\n\n💡 An account ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize an account by in your own systems. Ideally, the account ID should be a database ID.\n\n```ts\njourny(\"screen\", {\n  name: \"Account settings\",\n  accountId: \"30\",\n\n  // Optional\n  // Hash of the account ID using a backend secret\n  // You can find the secret in the website settings\n  // Recommended to prevent spoofing\n  verification: \"hash\",\n});\n```\n\n## Trigger an event\n \n💡 Use past tense for event names.\n\nUser events:\n\n```js\njourny(\"event\", {\n  // required\n  name: \"signed_in\",\n\n  // optional\n  metadata: {\n    key: \"value\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\nAccount events:\n\n💡 An account ID should be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize an account by in your own systems. Ideally, the account ID should be a database ID.\n\n```js\njourny(\"event\", {\n  // required\n  name: \"created_invoice\",\n  accountId: \"30\",\n\n  // Optional\n  // Hash of the account ID using a backend secret\n  // You can find the secret in the website settings\n  // Recommended to prevent spoofing\n  verification: \"hash\",\n\n  // optional\n  metadata: {\n    key: \"value\",\n    amount: 100,\n    allow_wire_transfer: true,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Identity verification\n\nIdentity verification ensures that one person can't impersonate another.\n\nIdentity verification requires you to add an hash (HMAC) (that you generate on your server using SHA256) to your installation snippet alongside your user ID and account ID.\n\njourny.io won't accept requests for a logged-in user without a valid hash. The hash is calculated using a secret key, which you should never share. Without this secret key, no third party can send journy.io a valid hash for one of your users, so they can't impersonate your users.\n\nThis is optional but highly recommended.\n\nYou can enable identify verification in the website settings in the connections view.\n\n```js\njourny(\"identify\", {\n  userId: \"userId\",\n  verification: \"USER_ID_HMAC_VALUE_HERE\"\n})\n\njourny(\"account\", {\n  accountId: \"accountId\",\n  verification: \"ACCOUNT_ID_HMAC_VALUE_HERE\"\n})\n\njourny(\"event\", {\n  accountId: \"accountId\",\n  verification: \"ACCOUNT_ID_HMAC_VALUE_HERE\"\n})\n```\n\n### PHP\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nhash_hmac(\n  'sha256', // hash function\n  id, // user or account ID\n  'secret' // secret key (keep safe!)\n);\n```\n \n### Node.js\n\n```js\nimport { createHmac } from \"crypto\"\n\ncreateHmac(\n  \"sha256\", // hash function\n  'secret' // secret key (keep safe!)\n).update(id).digest(\"hex\") // user or account ID\n```\n\n### Ruby\n\n```ruby\nOpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(\n  'sha256', # hash function\n  'secret', # secret key (keep safe!)\n  id.to_s # user or account ID\n)\n```\n\n### Python\n\n```\nimport hmac\nimport hashlib\n\nhmac.new(\n  b'secret', # secret key (keep safe!)\n  bytes(id, encoding='utf-8'), # user or account ID\n  digestmod=hashlib.sha256 # hash function\n).hexdigest()\n ```\n\n## Single page application\n\nYou can use our JavaScript snippet inside single page applications.\n\nYou should call `journy(\"screen\")` (or `journy(\"pageview\")`) whenever a user in your application transitions to another page. You can do this by listening to router change events. The current page URL will always be resolved using `window.location.href`.\n\nYou can trigger events using `journy(\"event\")` whenever you need to.\n\n### Next.js\n\nWe built a demo app with Next.js. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/journy-io/js-sdk-demo-app).\n \nThis [component](https://github.com/journy-io/js-sdk-demo-app/blob/main/components/Journy.js) should be a great start.\n\nYou can use the `Script` component from Next.js to load the web snippet and call `init`.\n\nDon't forget to listen on route changes. You can use the `useRouter` hook for that.\n\n### React Router v6\n\nYou can use the [`useLocation`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/api#uselocation) hook to listen for route changes:\n\n```js\nimport React, { useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const location = useLocation();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    journy(\"screen\", { name: \"name\" });\n    // or\n    journy(\"pageview\");\n  }, [location]);\n\n  return (\n      // ...\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Vue Router\n\nYou can use [`router.afterEach`](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html#global-after-hooks) to listen for route changes:\n\n```js\nconst router = new VueRouter({ ... });\n \nrouter.afterEach((to, from) => {\n  journy(\"screen\", { name: \"name\" });\n  // or\n  journy(\"pageview\");\n});\n```\n\nNote: We don't accept a page URL argument for `journy(\"pageview\")`. The current page URL will always be resolved using `window.location.href`.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nWe published an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journyio/web-types) with type definitions to enable type-safe usage of our JavaScript snippet. The code and documentation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/journy-io/web-types).\n \n## Localhost\n\nBy default a site doesn't allow page views from other domains than the registered domain. This makes it difficult to test your tracking implementation locally.\n\nYou can enable \"Allow any domain\" in the site settings to disable the domain check.\n\nThis will allow you to test the JavaScript snippet with localhost as hostname.\n\n# Backend\n\nThe journy.io API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.\n\nThe API is hosted on api.journy.io.\n\n## Official SDKs\n\nOur SDKs are designed to help you interact with our APIs with less friction. They are written in several different languages and help bridge the gap between your application and journy.io APIs. They take away the need to know the exact URL and HTTP method to use for each API call among other things leaving you more time to focus on making your application.\n\n| Language   | Package                                                                        | Source code                                                                |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n | 💚 Node.js | [npm install @journyio/sdk ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journyio/sdk)      | [github.com/journy-io/js-sdk](https://github.com/journy-io/js-sdk)         |\n| 🐘 PHP     | [composer require journy-io/sdk](https://packagist.org/packages/journy-io/sdk) | [github.com/journy-io/php-sdk](https://github.com/journy-io/php-sdk)       |\n | 🐍 Python  | [pip install journyio-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/journyio-sdk/)             | [github.com/journy-io/python-sdk](https://github.com/journy-io/python-sdk) |\n| 💎 Ruby    | Coming soon                                                                    | Coming soon                                                                |\n\nYour favourite programming language not included? [Let us know!](mailto:hi@journy.io)\n\nIn the meanwhile, you can use [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) to generate a client for your programming language.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe journy.io API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [connections screen](https://system.journy.io).\n\nYour API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.\n\nAll API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.\n\nFor every request send to the API we expect a header `X-Api-Key` to be set with the API Key.\n\n## Permissions\n\nWhen creating an API Key in [the application](https://system.journy.io) you will have the choice to give permissions to an API Key (which you can change later on). These permissions restrict the API Key from different actions. When an API Key tries to perform a certain action it doesn't have the permissions for, you will receive a `401: Unauthorized` response.\n\n## Rate limiting\n\nTo prevent abuse of the API there is a maximum throughput of 1800 requests per minute. If you need a higher throughput, please contact us.\n\nTo keep our platform healthy and stable, we'll block API keys that consistently hit our rate limits. Therefore, please consider taking this throughput into account.\n\nIn every response the headers `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` will be set. The `X-RateLimit-Limit`-header will always contain the current limit of requests per minute. The `X-RateLimit-Remaining`-header will always contain the amount of requests you have left in the current sliding window.\n\n💡 The client-side tracking uses different rate limits.\n\n## Errors\n \njourny.io uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g. a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with journy.io's servers (these are rare).\n\nWhen performing a `POST`- or `PUT`-request with a requestBody, or when including parameters, these parameters and fields will automatically be checked and validated against the API Spec. When any error occurs, you will get a response with an `errors`-field, structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"errors\": {\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"header\": {\n        \"headerParameterName\": \"Describe what's wrong with the header parameter.\",\n        ...\n      },\n      \"query\": {\n        \"queryParameterName\": \"Describe what's wrong with the query parameter.\",\n        ...\n      },\n      \"path\": {\n        \"pathParameterName\": \"Describe what's wrong with the path parameter.\",\n        ...\n      },\n    },\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"fieldName\": \"Describe what's wrong with the fieldName.\",\n      \"object.fieldName\": \"Describe what's wrong with the fieldName of the included object.\",\n       ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Best practices\n\n### Track accounts & users immediately on creation\n\nWhen you create an account in your database, immediately sending data about that account to journy.io helps your team stay in sync. The same goes for users. Call [Upsert account](#operation/upsertAccount) as soon as possible, right after the account is first created in your database.\n\n### Update account data daily\n\nNot every account is active every day. But, you may have properties on the account that change through background processing. That's why we recommend updating every one of your accounts' data in a recurring daily process. This way, you know that your accounts are updated every day in journy.io.\n\n ## Changelog\n\n### December 2021\n\n[POST /events](#operation/trackJourneyEvent) will be moved to [POST /track](#operation/trackEvent). [POST /events](#operation/trackJourneyEvent) is deprecated and will be removed in the future.",

The auth token of the user can be reset on the same page.\n\n![Store Login](/images/support/api/apilogin.png)\n \nThe auth token is a **32 characters** string.\n\nTo make authenticated requests, you can either use Basic Authentication  (recommend method) or provide the login and auth token in the URL parameters (deprecated method).\n\nIf you are developing a Jumpseller App, the authentication should be done using [OAuth-2](/support/oauth-2). Please read the article [Build an App](/support/apps) for more information.\n <br/><br/>\n## Query Parameters (deprecated)\nAssuming login is *XXXXX* and authtoken is *YYYYY* we present the following examples (the real values can be found on the left sidebar of the Account section, accessed from the main menu of your Admin Panel):\n### Curl Examples\nIn curl, you can invoke that URL with:  \n\n```bash\n curl -X GET \"https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXX&authtoken=YYYYY\"\n```\n\nTo create a product, you will include the JSON data and specify the MIME Type:  \n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -d '{ \"product\" : {\"name\": \"My new Product!\", \"price\": 100} }' \"https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXX&authtoken=YYYYY\" -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n```\n\nand to update the product identified with 123:  \n\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT -d '{ \"product\" : {\"name\": \"My updated Product!\", \"price\": 99} }' \"https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products/123.json?login=XXXXX&authtoken=YYYYY\" -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n```\n\nor delete it:  \n\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products/123.json?login=XXXXX&authtoken=YYYYY\" -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n```\n\n### PHP Examples\n```php\n$url = 'https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?login=XXXXX&authtoken=YYYYY';\n $ch = curl_init($url);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Content-Type: application/json'));\n\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, \"POST\"); //post method\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, '{ \"product\" : {\"name\": \"My updated Product!\", \"price\": 99} }');\n\n$result = curl_exec($ch);\nprint_r($result);\ncurl_close($ch);\n```\n\n## Basic Authentication\n Assuming login is *XXXXX* and authtoken is *YYYYY* we present the following examples (the real values can be found on the left sidebar of the Account section, accessed from the main menu of your Admin Panel):\n### Curl Examples\nIn curl, you can invoke that URL with:  \n\n```bash\ncurl -u XXXXX:YYYYY -X GET \"https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json\"\n```\n\nTo create a product, you will include the JSON data and specify the MIME Type:  \n\n```bash\ncurl -u XXXXX:YYYYY -X POST -d '{ \"product\" : {\"name\" : \"My new Product!\", \"price\": 100} }' \"https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json\" -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n```\n\nand to update the product identified with 123:  \n\n```bash\ncurl -u XXXXX:YYYYY -X PUT -d '{ \"product\" : {\"name\": \"My updated Product!\", \"price\": 99} }' \"https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products/123.json\" -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n```\n\nor delete it:  \n\n```bash\ncurl -u XXXXX:YYYYY -X DELETE \"https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products/123.json\" -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n```\n\n### PHP Examples\n```php\n$login = 'XXXXX';\n $authtoken = 'YYYYY';\n$url = 'https://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json';\n $ch = curl_init($url);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Content-Type: application/json'));\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERPWD, $login . \":\" . $authtoken);\n\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, \"POST\"); //post method\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, '{ \"product\" : {\"name\": \"My updated Product!\", \"price\": 99} }');\n\n$result = curl_exec($ch);\n print_r($result);\ncurl_close($ch);\n```\n\n ## OAuth2\n OAuth 2 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. Generally, OAuth provides to clients a secure delegated access to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials. Designed specifically to work with HTTP, OAuth essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner. The third party then uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.\n \nRead more about this type of authentication and how to implement it in your Jumpseller App by clicking [here](/support/oauth-2).\n***\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n# Plain JSON only. No XML.\n\n* We only support JSON for data serialization.\n* Our node format has no root element.  \n* We use snake_case to describe attribute keys (like \"created_at\").  \n* All empty value are replaced with **null** strings.\n * All API URLs end in .json to indicate that they accept and return JSON.\n* POST and PUT methods require you to explicitly state the MIME type of your request's body content as **\"application/json\"**.\n<br/><br/>\n***\n\n# Rate Limit\nYou can perform a maximum of:\n\n+ 800 (eight hundred) requests per minute and\n+ 20 (twenty) requests per second \n\nIf you exceed this limit, you'll get a 429 Too Many Requests (Rate Limit Exceeded) response for subsequent requests.  \n\n The rate limits apply by IP address and by store. This means that multiple requests on different stores are not counted towards the same rate limit.\n\nThis limits are necessary to ensure resources are correctly used. Your application should be aware of this limits and retry any unsuccessful request, check the following Ruby stub:\n\n```ruby\ntries = 0; limit = 3;\nbegin\n  HTTParty.send(method, uri) # perform an API call.\n  tries += 1\nrescue # 403 response\n  unless tries >= limit\n    sleep 1.0 # wait the necessary time before retrying the call again.\n    retry\n  end\nend\n```\n\nFinally, you can review the Response Headers of each request:\n\n```text\nJumpseller-PerMinuteRateLimit-Limit: 800  \nJumpseller-PerMinuteRateLimit-Remaining: 799 # requests available on the per-minute interval  \nJumpseller-PerSecondRateLimit-Limit: 20  \nJumpseller-PerSecondRateLimit-Remaining: 19 # requests available on the per-second interval\n``` \n\nto better model your application requests intervals.\n \nAfter 2000 rate-limit hits, we will set a temporary ban. The Response Header `Jumpseller-BannedByRateLimit-Reset` informs you the time (UTC) when will your ban be reseted:\n\n```text\nJumpseller-BannedByRateLimit-Reset: 2024-05-23T16:13:47+00:00\n ``` \n\n<br/><br/>\n***\n\n# Pagination\n\nBy default we will return 50 objects (products, orders, etc) per page. There is a maximum of 100, using a query string `&limit=100`.\nIf the result set gets paginated it is your responsibility to check the next page for more objects -- you do this by using query strings `&page=2`, `&page=3` and so on.\n\n```text\nhttps://api.jumpseller.com/v1/products.json?page=3&limit=100\n ```\n<br/><br/>\n***\n\n# More\n* [Jumpseller API wrapper](https://gitlab.com/jumpseller-api/ruby) provides a public Ruby abstraction over our API;\n* [Apps Page](/apps) showcases external integrations with Jumpseller done by technical experts;\n* [Imgbb API](https://api.imgbb.com/) provides an easy way to upload and temporaly host for images and files.\n<br/><br/>\n***\n<br/><br/>\n",

The cloud infrastructure guarantees high availability and autoscalability of the service. You can generate hundreds of thousands of images this way and use them however you like.\n\nWe realize that your API use case may require custom solutions, and perhaps we lack functionality that is very important to you. In that case feel free to write an email to our support and tell us about it. We have repeatedly added new functions of our service directly after the requests of our users.\n\n**General remarks:**\n - maximum request size is fixed at 32MB.\n - request timeout is fixed at 180 seconds.\n\n # Authentication\n\nThe LinQR offers two authentication schemes for accessing API. The first method is based on the OAuth2.0 protocol, where clients obtain client credentials for secure and direct access. Alternatively, you can authenticate through RapidAPI, a proxy service that handles authentication on behalf of the client. RapidAPI simplifies the process by acting as an intermediary between the client and LinQR's API.\n\nTo ensure optimal performance and efficiency, it is recommended to use the preferred OAuth2.0 scheme. This method provides secure and direct access to LinQR's API resources. While the alternative authentication scheme through RapidAPI is available, it may introduce additional latency or dependencies that could impact the overall speed and responsiveness of your API requests. Therefore, to maximize speed and reliability, it is advisable to utilize the direct authentication method provided by LinQR.\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->",

Please send an email to api@loket.nl, and we will get back to you.\n\n\n## Environments\nThe Loket.nl API has two different environments.\n The first environment is the \"acceptance\" environment which is used during development and returns test data.\nThe second environment is the production environment which is to be used exclusively by approved applications.\nBoth environments have their own URLs.\n* The acceptance environment can be accessed at https://api.loket-acc.nl/v2/ \n* The production environment can be accessed at https://api.loket.nl/v2/\n\n ## OpenAPI documentation\nThe endpoints are defined using the [OpenAPI 3.1 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification),\n an industry-wide recognized standard for describing REST API's.\n\n__Please note:__ the endpoint documentation in this portal is not designed to be fully compatible with any automatic code generation tools.\n\n## Change policy\nOver the course of time the API, and policies regarding the API can and will change. These changes are subject to the following guidelines.\n\n\nThe following states hold true for the change policy for this API.\n\n* Loket.nl may sometimes introduce changes to the API and policies without advance notice. \n* Loket.nl will try to inform users of any (breaking) change in advance.\n* Loket.nl will not be liable to you or any third party for such modifications or any adverse effects resulting from such modifications.\n* Loket.nl will try to avoid breaking changes as much as possible.\n\n## Notification periods\nIn regard to changes Loket.nl will strive to adhere to the following notification periods per type of change.\nDue to our versioning strategy at resource level this API has the possibility to run multiple versions of the same resource at one time.\nThis allows for a window in which both the old and new version are available.\nAllowing for a gradual move to the new version. \n\n| Type of change | Notification period | Support period old version |\n|------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Non breaking change | 2 weeks | no new version |\n| Breaking change | 2 weeks | 6 months |\n| Critical | Due to the nature of these changes we might not be able to follow the normal procedure for change managment | depends on the severity of the issue | \n\n\n We define a __non breaking__ change as follows. Any change to the API that does not cause failures in the applications that consume that API.\n  * Introducing a new optional field to an existing resource\n  * Introducing a new endpoint\n  * Introducing a new operation (GET/PUT/POST/PATCH/DELETE)\n  * Introducing a new optional parameter to an endpoint\n  * Introducing a new version for a resource\n \nWe define a __breaking change__ as follows. any change to an API that could potentially cause failures in the applications that consume that API.\n  * Changing an existing JSON element (name, datatype, pattern, min/max length etc)\n  * Removing a JSON element, endpoint, operation or parameter\n  * Introducing a required JSON element\n  * Introducing a required parameter to an endpoint\n  * Passing the `obsoleteDate` of a version for a resource\n\n## Versioning\nThe Loket API uses two types of versioning. API versioning and resource versioning. \n\n\n__API versioning__\n \nAPI versioning is done via the path where after the domain URL (api.loket.nl) the path starts with the API version. The current version of the API is V2.\n The API version is expected to change rarely as resource versioning is available to tackle most issues that need versioning.\n\n\n__Resource versioning__\n\nEvery __JSON__ resource in the API is versioned via the Accept header.\nAllowing users of the API to influence what version is returned by setting the __mandatory__ accept header.\nThe Accept header of request should have a value like `application/json;version=2018-01-01`. \nHere, the second part of the header is used to refer to a specific version of the resource (2018-01-01).\nWhen calling the API it is possible to supply other dates rather than the exact resources version(s). \nThe businesslogic will select the version that is ON or BEFORE the given date. If no accept header with a resource version is given the newest version of the resource is returned\n\n\n__For example:__ let's say there are two versions of a resource.\nThese are 2018-01-01 and 2018-09-01. When calling the API you supply `application/json;version=2018-08-01`,\nin that case the API will use the version 2018-01-01 as its the nearest version in the past.\n\n\nA response returns what `resourceVersion` was used and the 'obsoleteDate' of that version (in most cases this is NULL).\nThe `obsoleteDate` indicates when the resources version will no longer be available via the API.\nWith the introduction of a new version of a resource the `obsoleteDate` for the old version will be set to 6 months after the introduction of the new resource. \nAllowing consumers of the resource 6 months to incorporate the change. Failure to do so will likely lead to failure in the implementation.\n\nIn this developer portal you can find the service contracts for each, active, version of a resource.\nIf, only if, there are multiple versions of a resource you can select the corresponding schema at that resource.\n\n## Changelog\nThe changelog for this API can be found [here](/Changelog).\n \nWe strongly advise every user ofthe Loket REST API the subscribe to the email feed. Please check out the link on the changelog page.\n\n\n## Legal notices\n Your use and access to the API is expressly conditioned on your compliance with the policies and restrictions related to the API. \nIf Loket.nl believes that you have or attempted to violate any term, condition, or the spirit of these policies or agreements, your right to access and use the API may be temporarily or permanently revoked.  \n\n# Authentication\nAuthorization in the Loket API is based on the industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol. For general information on OAuth 2.0 we kindly refer to the publicly-available documentation, https://oauth.net/2/ \n\n \nAn authorized user is required to call the Loket API.\n\n__Note:__ This is an SSL-only API.\n\n__Note:__ Only TLS 1.2 is supported.\n\n| Environment          | TokenUrl                             | \n| -------------------- | --------------------------------     | \n| Acceptance           | https://oauth.loket-acc.nl/token     |\n| Production           | https://oauth.loket.nl/token         | \n\nThe following OAuth 2.0 flows are supported\n\n* Authorization Code flow (standard)\n* Refresh Token flow (extension on the Authorization Code Flow)\n* SSO flow (single sign-on)\n* Password flow\n\n## Authorization code flow\nFor most clients only the authorization_code (and thus refresh_token) will be supported. \nPassword grant type is not available for an external client.\n\nPlease click the link below to see documentation on implementing the authorization code flow by external clients.\n\n__[Documentation on implementing the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](./OauthCode)__\n\n## Refresh token flow\nAfter the authorization code flow yields a refresh token the refresh_token grant can be used to obtain an access/bearer token.\nThe expire time of the access/bearer is also returned in the response please take this into account.\nWith the refresh token flow the two factor step will be skipped.\n\n_Refresh token request example:_\n ```\nPOST /token \ngrant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={RefreshToken123}&client_Id={Client123}&client_secret={Secret123}\n ```\n\n_Refresh token response example:_\n```json\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"JESJDhMBy0NPTM9SiXmYAzW45clOiQ5wSyDq3VWluguGNoKym4WPSiJoTDx67TQ\",\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n  \"expires_in\": 3599,\n  \"refresh_token\": \"nGJtF6j6SeQbHAg\",\n  \"two_factor_state\": \"None\"\n}\n```\n## SSO flow\n The SSO (single sign-on) flow is based on OAuth 2.0 and requires the authorization flow to be completed.\n\n__For more information see:__ [Documentation on OAuth 2.0 SSO flow (for allowed clients)](./OauthSSO)\n\n\n__Please note:__ Among other things, it is possible to set up an SSO flow with both Loket en Werknemerloket.\n \n\n## Password flow\nThe password flow is typically NOT enabled for external clients. Only by exception will the password flow be enabled for security (and practical) reasons.\n\n_Password token request examples:_\n\n```\nPOST /token \ngrant_type=password&username={UserName123}&password={Password123}&client_Id={Client123}&client_secret={Secret123}\n ```\nWhether client_secret is required is dependent on the configuration of the client.\n\n# Authorization\nIn this section we explain how the API authorization service determines if a request is authorized or not.\n\n## The authorization entities\n\n| Entity | Description |\n| ----|----|\n| Client | Loket.nl used the client as an additional authorisation entity. By linking clients to activities clients can only perform those activities they are linked to. |\n| User  | Is linked to a client (by performing the authorization code flow) and to a set of rechten (configuration in loket.nl)|\n| Module (product) | Enables certain functionality for the provider/employer. Modules can be enabled and disabled on both provider and employer level.|\n| Role | Influences if certain \"rechten\" are available to the users with said role. It can also influence the scope of the data returned. For example: the API will deny an \"afdelings manager\" access to employee's that are not in the \"afdeling\" (department) that user is manager of|\n| Activity | Every action in the API has its own activity. Using the Open API 3.0 standard these activity names are incorporated in the documentation using the `operationId` and in most cases are named in the description of an endpoint.|\n| Rights (rechten) | Represent a group of activities.|\n\n## The authorization process\nThis flow assumes that both user and client are correctly configured and have access to the API. \n\n1. Does the client have access to the activity?\n2. Does the user have access to the activity (through \"recht\")?\n3. Does the role have access to the activity (through \"recht\")?\n4. Does the provider/employer have the required module enabled for the activity?\n5. Does the user have access to the specified entity/ID?\n\nIf the answer to all the questions above is yes then the request is authorized otherwise the request is denied with a HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden).\n See the simplified authorization flow in the figure below.\n\n__Side note:__ users are linked to rechten and clients are linked to activities. This leaves room for discrepancies.\nWhere a client cannot perform the activity because the client is not authorized to call that activity even though the user does have the \"recht\" granting access to the activity.\n\n![Loket authorization flow](../Authorization_flow_extern.png)\n \n## Which users can use the API\nIn almost all use-cases a Loket user should meet the following requirements to successfully setup an integration with that user.\n\n* The user must be a normal Loket user (so NOT a webservice user)\n* The user must be active (not blocked)\n* The user must have access to an employer \n  * For provider users this is done by assigning the user to the appropriate Team(s)\n  * For employer users this is done by creating a user for or linking the user to the appropriate employer(s)\n* The user must have all appropriate rights\n  * For provider users this is done by assigning appropriate rights via Team (or alternatively, directly to the user)\n  * For employer users this is done by assigning appropriate rights to the user on employer level\n\n\nHow to setup an integration is described in the [Authentication](../#section/Authentication) section.\n\n\n__Side notes:__ \n* A user can have access to multiple employers with different rights per employer.\n* Please note that users set up to use the SOAP webservices (webservicegebruikers) are in no way suited to perform calls to the RESTful API, these require entirely different user set-ups.\n* User management on production is typically done by the provider (i.e. the accountant) and sometimes the employer. This is NOT something Loket.nl itself can do.\n\n# Data\n\n## Data types\nThe Loket.nl API accepts and returns JSON.\nComform the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) the following data types are supported:\n* string\n* number (point is used to separate the integer part from the fractional part of a number)\n* integer (from OpenAPI)\n* object\n* array\n* boolean\n\nFor most of these types, further specifications can be found in the `format` and `pattern` specifications in the service contract. \nFor example a `format: date` added to a string field indicates a valid date must be supplied.\n\n## Metadata\nFields of the type 'metadata' are fields for which the possible values can be acquired via the metadata endpoint of the resource.\n \nThe metedata can be obtained by appending /metadata to the current endpoint.\n Using the GET verb the endpoint will return a JSON output with \"all\" the metadata for the given resource.\nIn some cases multiple requests are needed to obtain all the metadata required, an exmple is given below.\nTypically different metadata endpoints are availalbe for the POST and the PUT endpoint.\n\n\nIf metadata endpoints are avaible for a given endpoint/resource is mentioned in the description of that endpoint.\n\n### Example response\n```json\n{[\n  {\n      \"field\": \"gender\"\n      options: [\n          {\n          \"key\": 1,\n          \"value\":\"Man\"\n          }\n          {\n          \"key\": 2,\n          \"value\":\"Vrouw\"\n          }\n      ]\n   },\n   {\n      \"field\": \"country\"\n      options: [\n          {\n          \"isoCode\":\"NL\",\n          \"key\" : 530,\n          \"value\":\"Nederland\"\n          }\n          {\n          \"isoCode\":\"BE\",\n          \"key\": 540,\n          \"value\":\"België\"\n          }\n      ]\n   }\n\n]}\n\n```\n\n\n### Example urls\n\n__Acquiring  metadata for a POST Wage__\n```\n/v2/providers/employers/employees/employments/{employmentId}/wages/metadata\n ```\n\n\n__Acquiring metadata for a PUT employee__\n```\n/v2/providers/employers/employees/{employeeId}/metadata\n ```\n\n__Multiple requests to get all the metadata__\n\nIn some cases there are metadata fields dependant on the selected value off another metadata field.\n Such is the case when adding a new concept employee. This is done in the employer context while several of the metadata fields are dependant on the payrollAdministration context.\n\n\n__For example:__\n\n__Request 1__, first of a normal metadata request is performed. The response for this request will contain a list of payrolladministration for the given employer.\n```\n/v2/providers/employers/b869ded6-0659-4d8d-9a8a-f9e22425ec9c/jobapplicant/metadata\n ```\n\n__Request 2__, when a payrolladministration is selected perform a second request to acquire the payrolladministration specific metadata.\n```\n/v2/providers/employers/jobapplicant/metadata/payrolladministration/54369214-14a1-41ab-892a-ea8438e34d6f\n ```\n\n__Request 3__, if a `payScale` is selected perform a third request to acquire the `payGrade` for that `payScale`.\n```\n/v2/providers/employers/jobapplicant/metadata/salaryScaleType/54369214-14a1-41ab-892a-ea8438e34d6f\n ```\n\n### Types of metadata\nWe diferentiate between two types of metadata.\n \n1. Generic metadata field. The possible values for these fields are the same for every object no matter the provider, employer or employee etc. \nExamples are: country, gender and nationality.\n2. Context specific metadata field. Examples of contexts are employer, payroll administration, provider and Loket.nl.\nIn most cases the possible values for these field are resources in themselves and can be managed via the API. \nIf a metadata field is context specific the context is given in the description of the field. \nExamples are: function, department and leaveType.\n\n\n__Note:__ some context specific metadata field can have multiple contexts. \n\nFor example: it is possible to define an export set in the provider context. \nMaking that export set available for all payroll administrations linked to the provider. \nIt is also possible to add an export set in the payroll administration context. That export set is only available to that payroll administration.\nWhen requesting the metadata of export set the user will be presented with a combined list of the provider and payroll administration export sets.\n\n## Default values\n Many fields in the API have a default value. \nIn order to assist our API users to adhere to these defaults when creating a record (POST) we provide `/defaults` endpoints.\n\n* An object returned by the `defaults`endpoint resembles a fully expanded GET-object of that resource. The only case when a part of the object is NOT fully expanded is for a metaData-object that does not have a default value (for example '\"gender\":NULL'). \n    * Whether an object within the resource is of the type metaData is indicated in the service contracts of that resource.\n * Context is determined by the GUID given in the Path. Examples are employer, payroll administration, employee and employment.\n* A scope is sometimes required to determine the defaults values. A scope could be a date by which Loket.nl can determine what default was active on that date. \n  The scope can be set by supplying additional paraments in the request. If a scope is required but none is given the currently active or last know value is returned.\n* The fields with no default will be set to null (even if the field is normally non-nullable).\n* Because the GET-object is returned the readonly fields are also returned.\n\n\n\n__An example endpoint would be:__\n\n```\n/v2/providers/employers/employees/employments/{employmentId}/payrollperioddata/defaults\n ```\n\n__resulting in the following output:__\n\n```json\n{\n  \"payrollPeriod\": null,\n  \"shift\": {\n      \"shiftNumber\": 1\n  },\n  \"payslipType\": {\n      \"key\": 2\n  },\n  \"payslipText\": null,\n  \"distributionUnit\": {\n      \"key\": \"b14acd0d-75d7-4fc8-8b22-4a3924585cab\"\n  },\n  \"costCenter\": {\n      \"key\": 2\n  },\n  \"costUnit\": {\n      \"key\": 2\n  },\n  \"payrollComponents\": []\n}\n```\n\n__Note: Defaults endpoints are not yet generically available. If a Defaults endpoint exists this will be explicitly stated at that specific resource.__\n\n## Date chains\nFor most of the resources with a startDate and endDate a chain is maintained. Chain meaning that no records can overlap in time.\n Loket.nl has two types of chains.\n\n\n1) __Broken chain:__ It is possible for gaps te exist between the records. It is also possible to add new records in between or before existing records aslong as no overlap occures.\n\n2) __Linked chain:__ No gaps between records are allowed. Its only possible to add new records to the end of the chain resulting in the closing of the reviouse record with the start date -1 as end date.\n\n__Note:__ Chains are sometimes maintained with an additional context. For example, For `benefits and deductions` the broken chain is maintained per `payrollComponent`. \nIt is possible to have multiple active records for different `payrollComponent` never two active records for the same `payrollComponent`. \n \n## Custom export\nFor some GET (list) endpoints the API supports exporting (part of) the output JSON as a XML/CSV file. This is done by setting the `X-ReportInput` and `Accept` header.\n\nThe `Accept` header supports the following 2 options:\n * CSV (text/csv;version=yyyy-MM-dd)\n* Excel (application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet;version=yyyy-MM-dd)\n \n\nThe `X-ReportInput` is a custom header that requires a JSON object with the following structure as input.\n\n1. fileNameWithoutExtension --> The filename without extension for the report 'FileNameWithoutExtension'\n2. delimiter --> The delimiter to be used. If not set \",\" is used\n3. decimalSeparator --> The decimalSepartor for number fields. If not set \".\" is used. \n4. fields --> Array of fields.\n\n\n  The 'fields' object contains one or more fields with the following properties:\n1. fieldName --> A Xpath reference to the field to be included in the export\n2. reportColumnName --> The column name for the field\n3. format --> Allows only for date formatting. e.g. dd-MM-yyyy for csv or dd-mm-yyyy for Excel (Excel only usses lowercase)\n\n  3.1 For CSV: see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings\n\n  3.2 For Excel: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/number-format-codes-5026bbd6-04bc-48cd-bf33-80f18b4eae68\n \n__Example `X-ReportInput`:__\n```json\n{\n\"fileNameWithoutExtension\":\"MyExport\",\n\"delimiter\": \";\",\n\"decimalSepartor\": \",\",\n\"fields\":\n  [\n    {\n      \"fieldName\": \"startDate\",\n      \"reportColumnName\": \"In dienst datum\",\n      \"format\": \"dd-MM-yyyy\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"fieldName\": \"personalDetails.firstName\",\n      \"reportColumnName\": \"First Name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"fieldName\": \"personalDetails.lastName\",\n      \"reportColumnName\": \"Last Name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n__Example request:__\n```CURL\ncurl \n--location \n--request GET 'https://api.loket.nl/v2/providers/employers/155c8440-8ff6-4776-98db-5d2243a073e3/employees?orderby=employeeNumber' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--header 'Accept: text/csv;version=2020-08-18' \\\n--header 'X-ReportInput: {\"FileNameWithoutExtension\":\"MyExport\",\"Fields\":[{\"fieldName\":\"personalDetails.initials\",\"reportColumnName\":\"Initials\"},{\"fieldName\":\"personalDetails.firstName\",\"reportColumnName\":\"First name\"},{\"fieldName\":\"personalDetails.lastName\",\"reportColumnName\":\"Last name\"}]}' \\--header 'Authorization: Bearer ZKoiC_g_NfYA3v0' \\\n```\n\n\n# Request\n A request to the Loket.nl API consists of several components.\nEach of these components are discussed in this section.\n\n## Base URL\nThe API can be accessed at [https://api.loket.nl](https://api.loket.nl).\n The version of the API is specified in the URL. The current version of the Loket.nl API is version 2. To access version 2 of the API, one simply appends `v2` to the base URL. The full base URL of the API is therefore [https://api.loket.nl/v2](https://api.loket.nl/v2).\n \n## Endpoints\nThe endpoints defined in the OpenAPI definition of the Loket.nl API are appended to the base URL. For example, the endpoint `/providers/employers/{employerId}/employees` can be accessed at [https://api.loket.nl/v2/providers/employers/{employerId}/employees](https://api.loket.nl/v2/providers/employers/{employerId}/employees).\n \n## Path parameters\n\nMost endpoints require path parameter(s) in order to specify the context of the request. For example, the endpoint `/providers/employers/{employerId}/employees` contains the `employerId` path parameter. A path parameter is a unique identifier that identifies a specific resource, in this case an employer.\n\n## Pagination\n \nThe API supports two query parameters to control the pagination of the results: `pageNumber` and `pageSize`. Both of these query parameters only apply to endpoints that return lists of entities.\n\nThe `pageNumber` query parameter specifies which page of the collection to return. By default  `pageNumber` is set to 1 which returns the first page of the collection. Note: the pageNumber refers to the page (with a given number of entities), NOT to a specific entity within a page!\n\nThe `pageSize` query parameter influences the number of entities per page. By default `pageSize` is set to 250. Note that this default may change in the future. It is not recommended to depend on this default when developing for the Loket.nl API.\n\nExamples:\n \n* ```?pageNumber=2``` to return the second page\n* ```?pageSize=2``` to set the page size to two\n\n## Filtering\n\nThe API supports output filtering via the querystring parameter `filter`.\n\nFiltering is possible on all fields of the following datatypes:\n\n* string\n* integer\n* boolean\n* date-time\n* decimals\n \nThe following operators are available:\n\n| Operator             | Description           | Example                         |\n| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| Comparison Operators |                       |                                 |\n| eq                   | Equal                 | `city eq 'Redmond'`             |\n| ne                   | Not equal             | `city ne 'London'`              |\n| lk                   | Like                  | `city lk 'Lond'`                |\n| gt                   | Greater than          | `price gt 20`                   |\n| ge                   | Greater than or equal | `price ge 10`                   |\n| lt                   | Less than             | `price lt 20`                   |\n| le                   | Less than or equal    | `price le 100`                  |\n| Logical Operators    |                       |                                 |\n| and                  | Logical and           | `price le 200 and price gt 3.5` |\n| or                   | Logical or            | `price le 3.5 or price gt 200`  |\n\nBoth field names and values are case insensitive. It is possible to filter on nested fields by adding the parent object before the field with a '.' to separate them.\nDo remember to URL encode the filter parameters.\n\n### Examples\n\nAll employments with a cancellation periode in months (the value 4 corresponds to months time unit).\n\n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers/{{employerId}}/employees/employments?filter=cancellationPeriodTimeUnit.key eq 4\n\n```\n\nAll employments with no endDate.s\n\n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers/{{employerId}}/employees/employments?filter=enddate eq null\n\n```\n\n\nAll employments with an end date less or equal to 2017-01-01\n \n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers/{{employerId}}/employees/employments?filter=enddate le '2017-01-01'\n\n```\n\nAll employees with a employee number greater or equal 1 and less or equal 5\n\n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers/{{employerId}}/employees?filter=employeeNumber ge 1 and employeeNumber le 5\n\n```\n\n## Ordering\n\nAll Loket.nl API resources support ordering of the elements in the response on a specific field. \nAll fields can be used in ordering. \nThe list can be ordered in ascending or descending order, with ascending being the default one. Ordering on multiple fields is also  by using a ',' as a separator.\n\n### Examples\n\nOrder employers by company name ascending\n\n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers?orderBy=companyName\n\n```\n\n Order employers by company name descending\n\n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers?orderBy=-companyName\n \n```\n\nOrder employers by company name descending then by house number ascending\n \n```\n\n/v2/providers/employers?orderBy=-companyName,address.houseNumber\n\n ```\n\n## Headers\n\nIn order to access the endpoints of the Loket.nl API, at least two request headers need to be set. \n\n\n__1)__ the `Authorization` header is required in order to authorize the API call. \nThe value of this header is the word Bearer followed by a space and the access token acquired from the `/token` endpoint. \nFor example, if the acquired access token is `AbCdEf123456`, the value of the `Authorization` headers would be:\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer v69uloc3wcEFLePw2unot0FfAJfBocrvSwsrCo75JLUG7aE54zqSUnU\n ```\n\n__2)__ The second header that is required for proper usage of the API, is the `Accept` header.\nThis header is used for the resource versioning feature and is therefore crucial for making sure the response remains the same when new resource versions are introduced.\nThe value of the `Accept` header differs per endpoint is defined in the OpenAPI documentation of the endpoints.\n\n```\nAccept: application/json;version=2018-01-01\n```\n\n# Response\n\nIn addition to the responses defined in the OpenAPI documentation, the Loket.nl API also provides additional fields that give more information about\nthe response and the entities requested. This section will explain the full response given by the Loket.nl API by examining the example response below.\n\n\nExample 400 response\n\n\n```json\n\n{\n    \"version\": {\n        \"obsoleteDate\": null,\n        \"versionNumber\": \"2018-01-01,\n    },\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"code\": 83,\n            \"id\": null,\n            \"type\": \"BrokenBusinessRule\",\n            \"description\": \"[field] has an invalid length\",\n            \"properties\": []\n        }\n    ],\n    \"_embedded\": []\n}\n\n```\n\n\nExample 200 response\n\n```json\n\n  {\n      \"totalSize\": 1,\n      \"pageSize\": 250,\n      \"totalPages\": 1,\n      \"currentPage\": 1,\n      \"version\": {\n          \"obsoleteDate\": null,\n          \"resourceVersion\": \"2018-01-01\"\n      },\n      \"messages\": [],\n      \"content\": {\n          \"id\": \"2b4c119c-527c-4cbb-a5b2-f3a11e4b76cx\",\n          ...\n      }\n  }\n\n```\n\n## Paging\n* `totalSize` has an integer value indicating the total number of entities irrespective of the page size.\n \n* `pageSize` has an integer value indicating the maximum number of entities returned per page. The page size can be influenced by setting the `pageSize` query parameter. See the section Query Parameters for more information.\n\n* `totalPages` has an integer value indicating the number of pages the requested collection holds given the specific pagesize.\n\n* `currentPage` has an integer value indicating the current page number. The current page number can be influenced by setting the `pageNumber` query parameter. See the section Query Parameters for more information.\n \n## Version\nThe `version` object provides information regarding the resource version of the entity requested.\n\n  * `obsoleteDate` contains the date of discontinuation for the requested resource version. The value of this field can be `null` indicating that the requested resource version is not planned to be obsoleted at the time of the request.\n\n  * `resourceVersion` shows the version of the requested entity. The resource version can be influenced by setting the `Accept` header.\n\n## Messages\n The `messages` field contains a list of message objects related to the request made. Any warnings and errors will be communicated in this list of messages\n\n  * `type` has a string value indicating the type of message. At this time the Loket.nl API supports five types of messages: `BrokenBusinessRule`, `Warning`, `Exception` and `NotFound` .\n  \n  * `description` has a string value that describes the message that has occurred.\n\n  * `code` is an identifying code for the message. Please note that this code may change in the future. See the documentation portal for possible message codes for an endpoint.\n\n  * `id` relates the message to a specific entity in the reponse list. For example, in cases where a warning occurs for one of the entities in a list, the value of this field can be used to identify to which entity the warning applies. Currently implemented for endpoints where a multi-patch is performed (multiple actions are performed within one call) for example updating the status of one or more leaveRequests. \n  \n  * `properties` an array that can contain additional information regarding the message. Currently not yet fully implemented.\n\n* `_embedded` contains the list of entities as defined for each endpoint in the OpenAPI documentation. Please refer to that documentation for the contents of the `_embedded` field for each endpoint. For endpoints that return only one entity (detail endpoints) the `_embedded` field is replaced with a `content` field. The content of this field can also be found in the documentation for each endpoint.\n\n## Headers\n* `Expires` header is returned with every response to indicate how long a response can be cached\n* `Content-Disposition` header is used in case of downloads to provide a file name\n\n## HTTP status codes\n\n The Loket.nl API supports the following http status codes.\n\n| Code | Is returned when |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| 200 | The request to GET, PUT, PATCH or DELETE and object was recived and processed successfully. The response might still contain messages of the type warning. |\n| 201 | The request to insert (POST) a new object was recived and processed successfully. The response might still contain messages of the type warning.|\n| 400 | The request was received but could not be processed. The reason(s) will be given in the response. The content type of the response may be text/plain for API-level error messages, such as when trying to call the API without SSL otherwise the content will be application/json.  |\n| 401 | The bearer token provided in the authorization header is invalid. Do not retry the request until a new (valid) bearer token is acquired. |\n| 403 | The user is not authorized to access the resource. The reason will be given in the response. Do not retry the request until the, configuration, issue is resolved. |\n| 404 | The resource requested was not found/does not exist. |\n| 50* | A unforseen error occurred. Please check the request if everything seems te be in order on your side contact the support team. Provide as much information as possible to resolve the issue. |\n\nNote: for a limited number of endpoint a so-called multi-patch may be performed (multiple actions within one call). In that case the status code will be 200 if at least on of the actions succeeds, if other any action(s) in that call fail(s) a message will be returned including the given id of that entity.\n \n## Caching\nThe API uses the `Expires` header to indicate how long the item can be reused from the local cache.\nIn most cases caching is not allowed for resources.\nExceptions excist, such as pictures like the employer logo and the employee photo, in these cases the cache duration is mentioned in the description of the resource.\n",

      "description": "Musixmatch lyrics API is a robust service that permits you to search and retrieve lyrics in the simplest possible way. It just works.\n\nInclude millions of licensed lyrics on your website or in your application legally.\n\nThe fastest, most powerful and legal way to display lyrics on your website or in your application.\n\n#### Read musixmatch API Terms & Conditions and the Privacy Policy:\nBefore getting started, you must take a look at the [API Terms & Conditions](http://musixmatch.com/apiterms/) and the [Privacy Policy](https://developer.musixmatch.com/privacy). We’ve worked hard to make this service completely legal so that we are all protected from any foreseeable liability. Take the time to read this stuff.\n\n#### Register for an API key:\nAll you need to do is [register](https://developer.musixmatch.com/signup) in order to get your API key, a mandatory parameter for most of our API calls. It’s your personal identifier and should be kept secret:\n\n```\n  https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/v1.1/track.get?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY\n```\n#### Integrate the musixmatch service with your web site or application\nIn the most common scenario you only need to implement two API calls: \nThe first call is to match your catalog to ours using the [track.search](#!/Track/get_track_search) function and the second is to get the lyrics using the [track.lyrics.get](#!/Lyrics/get_track_lyrics_get) api. That’s it!\n\n## API Methods\nWhat does the musiXmatch API do?\n\nThe musiXmatch API allows you to read objects from our huge 100% licensed lyrics database.\n\nTo make your life easier we are providing you with one or more examples to show you how it could work in the wild. You’ll find both the API request and API response in all the available output formats for each API call. Follow the links below for the details.\n\nThe current API version is 1.1, the root URL is located at https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/\n\nSupported input parameters can be found on the page [Input Parameters](https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation/input-parameters). Use UTF-8 to encode arguments when calling API methods.\n\nEvery response includes a status_code. A list of all status codes can be consulted at [Status Codes](https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation/status-codes).\n\n## Music meta data\nThe musiXmatch api is built around lyrics, but there are many other data we provide through the api that can be used to improve every existent music service.\n\n## Track\nInside the track object you can get the following extra information:\n\n### TRACK RATING\n\nThe track rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is a song in musixmatch.\n\nYou can use this information to sort search results, like the most popular songs of an artist, of a music genre, of a lyrics language.\n\n### INSTRUMENTAL AND EXPLICIT FLAGS\n\nThe instrumental flag identifies songs with music only, no lyrics.\n\nThe explicit flag identifies songs with explicit lyrics or explicit title. We're able to identify explicit words and set the flag for the most common languages.\n\n### FAVOURITES\n\nHow many users have this song in their list of favourites.\n\nCan be used to sort tracks by num favourite to identify more popular tracks within a set.\n\n### MUSIC GENRE\n\nThe music genere of the song.\n\nCan be used to group songs by genre, as input for similarity alghorithms, artist genre identification, navigate songs by genere, etc.\n\n### SONG TITLES TRANSLATIONS\n\nThe track title, as translated in different lanauages, can be used to display the right writing for a given user, example:\n\nLIES (Bigbang) becomes 在光化門 in chinese\nHALLELUJAH (Bigbang) becomes ハレルヤ in japanese\n\n\n## Artist\nInside the artist object you can get the following nice extra information:\n\n### COMMENTS AND COUNTRY\n\nAn artist comment is a short snippet of text which can be mainly used for disambiguation.\n\nThe artist country is the born country of the artist/group\n\nThere are two perfect search result if you search by artist with the keyword \"U2\". Indeed there are two distinct music groups with this same name, one is the most known irish group of Bono Vox, the other is a less popular (world wide speaking) group from Japan.\n\nHere's how you can made use of the artist comment in your search result page:\n\nU2 (Irish rock band)\nU2 (あきやまうに)\nYou can also show the artist country for even better disambiguation:\n\nU2 (Irish rock band) from Ireland\nU2 (あきやまうに) from Japan\nARTIST TRANSLATIONS\n\nWhen you create a world wide music related service you have to take into consideration to display the artist name in the user's local language. These translation are also used as aliases to improve the search results.\n\nLet's use PSY for this example.\n\nWestern people know him as PSY but korean want to see the original name 싸이.\n\nUsing the name translations provided by our api you can show to every user the writing they expect to see.\n\nFurthermore, when you search for \"psy gangnam style\" or \"싸이 gangnam style\" with our search/match api you will still be able to find the song.\n\n### ARTIST RATING\n\nThe artist rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is an artist in musixmatch.\n\nYou can use this information to build charts, for suggestions, to sort search results. In the example above about U2, we use the artist rating to show the irish band before the japanese one in our serp.\n\n### ARTIST MUSIC GENRE\n\nWe provide one or more main artist genre, this information can be used to calculate similar artist, suggestions, or the filter a search by artist genre.\n\n\n\n## Album\nInside the album object you can get the following nice extra information:\n\n### ALBUM RATING\n\nThe album rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is an album in musixmatch.\n\nYou can use this information to sort search results, like the most popular albums of an artist.\n\n### ALBUM RATING\n\nThe album rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is an album in musixmatch.\n\nYou can use this information to sort search results, like the most popular albums of an artist.\n\n### ALBUM COPYRIGHT AND LABEL\n\nFor most of our albums we can provide extra information like for example:\n\nLabel: Universal-Island Records Ltd.\nCopyright: (P) 2013 Rubyworks, under license to Columbia Records, a Division of Sony Music Entertainment.\nALBUM TYPE AND RELEASE DATE\n\nThe album official release date can be used to sort an artist's albums view starting by the most recent one.\n\nAlbum can also be filtered or grouped by type: Single, Album, Compilation, Remix, Live. This can help to build an artist page with a more organized structure.\n\n### ALBUM MUSIC GENRE\n\nFor most of the albums we provide two groups of music genres. Primary and secondary. This information can be used to help user navigate albums by genre.\n\nAn example could be:\n\nPrimary genere: POP\nSecondary genre: K-POP or Mandopop\n",

With the Semantic API, you get access to the long list of people, places, organizations and other locations, entities and descriptors that make up the controlled vocabulary used as metadata by The New York Times (sometimes referred to as Times Tags and used for Times Topics pages).\n\nThe Semantic API uses concepts which are, by definition, terms in The New York Times controlled vocabulary. Like the way facets are used in the Articles API, concepts are a good way to uncover articles of interest in The New York Times archive, and at the same time, limit the scope and number of those articles. The Semantic API maps to external semantic data resources, in a fashion consistent with the idea of linked data. The Semantic API also provides combination and relationship information to other, similar concepts in The New York Times controlled vocabulary.\n",

      "description": "# Summary\nThe **Swiss NextGen API** is based on the NextGenPSD2 *Framework Version 1.3.4* of the Berlin Group which offers a modern, open, harmonised and interoperable set of\nApplication Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the safest and most efficient way to provide data securely.\nThe NextGen Framework reduces XS2A complexity and costs, addresses the problem of multiple competing standards\nin Europe and, aligned with the goals of the Euro Retail Payments Board,\nenables European banking customers to benefit from innovative products and services ('Banking as a Service')\nby granting TPPs safe and secure (authenticated and authorised) access to their bank accounts and financial data.\n\nThe Swiss edtion refines the message formats specific to Switzerland and defines some matching examples.\n\nThe possible Approaches are:\n  * Redirect SCA Approach\n  * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) OAuth SCA Approach*\n  * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) Decoupled SCA Approach*\n  * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) Embedded SCA Approach without SCA method*\n  * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) Embedded SCA Approach with only one SCA method available*\n  * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) Embedded SCA Approach with Selection of a SCA method*\n\n  Not every message defined in this API definition is necessary for all approaches.\n  Furthermore this API definition does not differ between methods which are mandatory, conditional, or optional\n  Therefore for a particular implementation of a compliant API it is only necessary to support\n  a certain subset of the methods defined in this API definition.\n\n  **Please have a look at the implementation guidelines if you are not sure\n  which message has to be used for the approach you are going to use.**\n\n## Some General Remarks Related to this version of the OpenAPI Specification:\n* **This API definition is based on the Implementation Guidelines of the [Berlin Group API](https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads).**\n  It is not a replacement in any sense.\n  The main specification is (at the moment) always the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group API.\n* **This API definition contains the REST-API for requests from the PISP to the ASPSP.**\n* **This API definition contains the messages for all different approaches defined in the Implementation Guidelines.**\n* According to the OpenAPI-Specification [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md]\n\n    \"If in is \"header\" and the name field is \"Accept\", \"Content-Type\" or \"Authorization\", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored.\"\n\n  The element \"Accept\" will not be defined in this file at any place.\n\n  The elements \"Content-Type\" and \"Authorization\" are implicitly defined by the OpenApi tags \"content\" and \"security\".\n\n* There are several predefined types which might occur in payment initiation messages,\n  but are not used in the standard JSON messages in the Implementation Guidelines.\n  Therefore they are not used in the corresponding messages in this file either.\n  We added them for the convenience of the user.\n  If there is a payment product, which needs these fields, one can easily use the predefined types.\n  But the ASPSP need not to accept them in general.\n\n* **We omit the definition of all standard HTTP header elements (mandatory/optional/conditional)\n  except they are mentioned in the Implementation Guidelines.**\n  Therefore the implementer might add these in his own realisation of a comlient API in addition to the elements defined in this file.\n\n## General Remarks on Data Types\n\nThe Berlin Group definition of UTF-8 strings in context of the API have to support at least the following characters\n\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n/ - ? : ( ) . , ' +\n\nSpace\n",

      "description": "For general questions and support of the API, contact: webservices@paylocity.com\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\nPaylocity Web Services API is an externally facing RESTful Internet protocol. The Paylocity API uses HTTP verbs and a RESTful endpoint structure. OAuth 2.0 is used as the API Authorization framework. Request and response payloads are formatted as JSON.\r\nPaylocity supports v1 and v2 versions of its API endpoints. v1, while supported, won't be enhanced with additional functionality. For direct link to v1 documentation, please click [here](https://docs.paylocity.com/weblink/guides/Paylocity_Web_Services_API/v1/Paylocity_Web_Services_API.htm). For additional resources regarding v1/v2 differences and conversion path, please contact webservices@paylocity.com.\r\n\r\n##### Setup\r\n\r\nPaylocity will provide the secure client credentials and set up the scope (type of requests and allowed company numbers). You will receive the unique client id, secret, and Paylocity public key for the data encryption. The secret will expire in 365 days. \r\n* Paylocity will send you an e-mail 10 days prior to the expiration date for the current secret. If not renewed, the second e-mail notification will be sent 5 days prior to secret's expiration. Each email will contain the code necessary to renew the client secret. \r\n* You can obtain the new secret by calling API endpoint using your current not yet expired credentials and the code that was sent with the notification email. For details on API endpoint, please see Client Credentials section. \r\n* Both the current secret value and the new secret value will be recognized during the transition period. After the current secret expires, you must use the new secret. \r\n* If you were unable to renew the secret via API endpoint, you can still contact Service and they will email you new secret via secure email.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen validating the request, Paylocity API will honor the defaults and required fields set up for the company default New Hire Template as defined in Web Pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Authorization\r\n\r\nPaylocity Web Services API uses OAuth2.0 Authentication with JSON Message Format.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll requests of the Paylocity Web Services API require a bearer token which can be obtained by authenticating the client with the Paylocity Web Services API via OAuth 2.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe client must request a bearer token from the authorization endpoint:\r\n\r\n\r\nauth-server for production: https://api.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token\r\n\r\n\r\nauth-server for testing: https://apisandbox.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token\r\n\r\nPaylocity reserves the right to impose rate limits on the number of calls made to our APIs. Changes to API features/functionality may be made at anytime with or without prior notice.\r\n\r\n##### Authorization Header\r\n\r\nThe request is expected to be in the form of a basic authentication request, with the \"Authorization\" header containing the client-id and client-secret. This means the standard base-64 encoded user:password, prefixed with \"Basic\" as the value for the Authorization header, where user is the client-id and password is the client-secret.\r\n\r\n##### Content-Type Header\r\n\r\nThe \"Content-Type\" header is required to be \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\".\r\n\r\n##### Additional Values\r\n\r\nThe request must post the following form encoded values within the request body:\r\n\r\n    grant_type = client_credentials\r\n    scope = WebLinkAPI\r\n\r\n##### Responses\r\n\r\nSuccess will return HTTP 200 OK with JSON content:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"access_token\": \"xxx\",\r\n      \"expires_in\": 3600,\r\n      \"token_type\": \"Bearer\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n# Deductions (v1)\r\n\r\nDeductions API provides endpoints to retrieve, add, update and delete deductions for a company's employees. For schema details, click <a href=\"https://docs.paylocity.com/weblink/guides/Paylocity_Web_Services_API/v1/Paylocity_Web_Services_API.htm\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n# OnBoarding (v1)\r\n\r\nOnboarding API sends employee data into Paylocity Onboarding to help ensure an easy and accurate hiring process for subsequent completion into Web Pay. For schema details, click <a href=\"https://docs.paylocity.com/weblink/guides/Paylocity_Web_Services_API/v1/Paylocity_Web_Services_API.htm\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.",

      "description": "ContentDepot hosts a range of API’s that allow clients to manage, discover, and obtain content. The API spans many parts of the ContentDepot functionality including MetaPub (a.k.a. metadata distribution) and content management.\n\n## MetaPub\n\nMetaPub collects, normalizes and distributes publicly available program, episode, and piece metadata through the public radio system. Backed by ContentDepot and its data model, MetaPub allows producers to supply metadata through various methods:\n\n1. MetaPub Agents that collect producer metadata by \"crawling\" existing public feeds (e.g. C24, BBC) or the producer's production system (e.g. ATC, ME, TED Radio Hour).\n2. Manually enter metadata in the ContentDepot Portal on each program and episode.\n3. Publish/push the metadata to the MetaPub upload API and execute an ingest job.\n\nMetaPub then distributes this data to stations through an electronic program guide (EPG model) for display on various listener devices such as smart phones, tablets, web streams, HD radios, RDBS enabled FM radios, and more. The EPG format is based on the RadioDNS specifications.\n\n### RadioDNS\n\nThe RadioDNS Service and Programme Information Specification ([ETSI TS 102 818 v3.4.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102800_102899/102818/03.04.01_60/ts_102818v030401p.pdf)) defines three primary documents: Service Information, Program Information, and Group Information. These documents, along with the core RadioDNS Hybrid Lookup for Radio Services Specification ([ETSI TS 103 270 v1.4.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103270/01.04.01_60/ts_103270v010401p.pdf)), define a system where an end listener device can dynamically discover program metadata and fetch the metadata via Internet Protocol (IP) requests. MetaPub's use of RadioDNS differs slightly in that MetaPub (a.k.a PRSS) acts as the \"service provider\" while the stations and related middleware act as the end devices. While this is not the primary use case of RadioDNS, the flexibility in the specification, service definitions, and DNS resolution allows this model to be easily represented. MetaPub provides both _National Metadata_ and _Station Metadata_.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that the related [RadioDNS specifications](https://radiodns.org/developers/documentation/) be read for implementation details, definitions, and required XML schemas.\n\n## ContentDepot Drive\n\nContentDepot Drive (CD Drive) provides a private, per customer file storage solution similar to other cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive, Box, and Dropbox. The CD Drive is used to stage content uploads such as metadata files, images, or segment audio before associating the content with specific programs or episodes.\n\nCD Drive content can be referenced using a URI by some operations such as synchronizing metadata. There are two possible CD Drive URI formats supported: ID and hierarchical path. The ID reference takes the form ```cddrive:id:{value}``` where value is the integer ID of the file or folder being referenced. The hierarchical path reference takes the form ```cddrive://{path}``` where path is the full, UNIX style path to the file or folder starting with '/'. For example, two CD Drive URIs pointing to the same file may be ```cddrive:id:12345``` and ```cddrive:///show1/episode2/metadata.xml```. More information about URIs can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe API currently uses OAuth 2.0.  All operations require ```cd:full``` access where the client access is only limited by the permissions of the ContentDepot user after authentication. Limiting access scope per client is not currently supported.\n",

[Legal](#section/Legal)\n\n# Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Rubrik™ REST API documentation.\n\nThe Rubrik REST API provides a RESTful interface for working with Rubrik clusters and Rubrik Edge virtual appliances. The Rubrik REST API can be used to query, configure, and control nearly all of the operations of the Rubrik software.\n\nThrough authenticated and encrypted interaction with the Rubrik REST API server, perform any of the operations that are available through the Rubrik web UI and many bulk-type operations that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to perform.\n\nThis documentation provides reference information and examples of typical workflows for the Rubrik REST API. For more detailed information about working with Rubrik clusters and Rubrik Edge virtual appliances refer to the *Rubrik User Guide*.\n\nA quick way to become familiar with the Rubrik REST API, is to use the Rubrik REST API Explorer. [OpenAPI](#section/OpenAPI) describes this tool.\n\nRefer to the [changelog](#section/Changelog) to see information about changes within this version of the Rubrik REST API.\n\n# Changelog\n\n

This allows users to\n   filter virtual machines based on the guest operating system name.\n * Enhanced GET /vmware/vm/snapshot/{id} response by adding disk details\n   such as fileName and deviceKey.\n * Added isMountAllowed field to the response of GET\n   /mssql/db/{id}/recoverable_range. This helps identify which recoverable\n   ranges support Live Mount, which is affected by whether a database snapshot\n   contains filestreams.\n * Added optional query parameters limit and offset to support pagination for\n   GET /mssql/db endpoint.\n * Added optional query parameters sortOrder and sortBy to enable users to\n   sort the results of GET /mssql/db endpoint by effectiveSlaDomainId and name.\n\n ### Changes to V1 API in Rubrik Version 4.2\n ## Breaking changes:\n * The input field OperatingSystemType value `Linux` is replaced by `UnixLike`.\n   in FilesetTemplateCreateDefinition, used by POST /fileset-template, and\n   in FilesetTemplatePatchDefinition, used by PATCH /fileset_template/{id}.\n * The input field operating_system_type value `Linux` is replaced by `UnixLike`.\n   in GET /fileset-template and GET /host.\n\n ## New features:\n * Added a new /ldap_service endpoint for managing Active Directory integration.\n * Added a new optional field 'nasBaseConfig' to GET /api/v1/host. This field\n   allows NAS (Isilon/NetApp) api credential to be displayed and edited.\n * GET /host/{id}/search now returns search results for filesets, Windows volume\n   groups, and storage array volume groups belonging to the host. Previously,\n   the endpoint would only return fileset search results.\n * Added endpoints for actions related to log shipping configurations:\n   POST /mssql/db/{id}/log_shipping to create, GET /mssql/db/log_shipping to\n   query, GET /mssql/db/log_shipping/{id} to retrieve individual details,\n   DELETE /mssql/db/log_shipping/{id} to delete, and POST\n   /mssql/db/log_shipping/{id}/reseed to reseed an unhealthy secondary\n   database.\n * Added `Africa/Johannesburg`, `Africa/Lagos` and `Africa/Nairobi` as\n   supported cluster time zones.\n ## Improvements:\n * Added 2 new optional fields `apiHostname` and `zoneName` to POST /host\n   and GET /host. These fields allow different zones to be configured for\n   Isilon NAS.\n * Added a new field 'geolocation' to GET /cluster/{id} and PATCH /cluster/{id}.\n   These allow users to view and modify the geolocation of the cluster,\n   respectively.\n * Added a new field `guestOsType` to the `VirtualMachineDetail`.\n   object used in response of `GET /vmware/vm/{id}`.\n * Added an optional organizationId field to the HostRegister request in POST\n   /host to allow users with the global admin RBAC role to add a host to an\n   organization specified by the value of the organizationId field.\n * Added canLiveMount field to the responses of `GET /mssql/db/snapshot/{id}`.\n   and `GET /mssql/db/{id}/snapshot`.\n * Added an optional field `agentStatus` to `VirtualMachineSummary` object used\n   in response of `GET /vmware/vm` endpoint. This allows user to check the\n   Rubrik Backup Service connection status of the corresponding VMware VM.\n * Added the `POST /vmware/vm/{id}/register_agent` endpoint.\n * Added a new field 'createDatastoreOnly' to POST\n   /vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/mount. This allows user to mount snapshot to vmware\n   datastore only, without create a virtual machine.\n * Added a new field `numWindowsVolumeGroups` to the `SlaDomainDetail` and\n   `SlaDomainSummary` objects used in response to `GET /sla_domain` endpoints.\n * Added new optional field 'shouldRefreshCacheAfterUpdate' for PATCH\n   /vmware/vm/{id} to indicate whether or not to refresh the in-memory cache\n   after updates to a virtual machine record.\n\n ### Changes to V1 API in Rubrik Version 4.1\n\n ## Breaking changes:\n * The 'allowedBackupWindow' and 'firstFullBackupWindow' input field for\n   /sla_domain now take the cluster time zone instead of UTC.\n\n ## New features:\n * Added POST /host/{id}/refresh endpoint to refresh hosts without\n   registering them again\n * Added GET /fileset/snapshot/{id} endpoint to retrieve details of a\n   fileset snapshot.\n * Added POST /mssql/db/{id}/log_backup endpoint for taking on-demand\n   log backup of SQL Server databases.\n * Added a new optional query parameter 'is_agentless' to\n   GET /windows_cluster. This allows users to filter all clusters that\n   do not have any hosts with Rubrik connectors installed. If this\n   parameter is omitted, all clusters are returned.\n * Added a new field 'isAgentless' to GET /windows_cluster. This indicates\n   whether all the hosts on this windows cluster do not have Rubrik connector\n   installed. If even one host has Rubrik connector installed, this will\n   be set to false.\n * Added a new optional 'organization_id' query parameter on POST /session.\n   This allows users to specify the organization to which they intend to\n   authenticate. If this parameter is omitted, an organization is chosen\n   automatically.\n * Added a new 'organizationId' field to the response on POST /session. This\n   indicates the organization to which the user has authenticated.\n * Added a new field 'moid' on GET /vmware/vm. This allows users to search\n   VMWare VMs by Managed Object ID. The list of results of the call can now\n   additionally be sorted in ascending/descending order by moid.\n * Added new fields 'replicas' and 'availabilityGroupId' on GET /mssql/db\n   and GET /mssql/db/{id}. If a database is an availability database,\n   it will have some number of replicas, which are copies of the database\n   running on different instances. Otherwise, there will only be one\n   replica, which represents the single copy of the database. The field\n   'availabilityGroupId' will be set only for availability databases\n   and points to the availability group of the database. Also deprecated\n   several fields on these endpoints, as they should now be accessed via\n   the 'replicas' field.\n * Added a field 'cloudInstantiationSpec' on GET /vmware/vm and PATCH\n   /vmware/vm/{id} to allow enabling/disabling/updating specs for automatic\n   conversion to cloud image on a per VM basis\n * Added a new optional query parameter 'availabilityGroupId' to GET /mssql/db,\n   in order to filter databases by their availability group ID.\n * Added a new field 'timezone' to GET /cluster/{id} and PATCH /cluster/{id}.\n   These calls show and change, the current time zone setting of the cluster.\n * Add a new field 'ignoreErrors' to POST /vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/restore_file\n   that will let job to ignore file errors during restore jobs.\n * Added `Asia/Kolkata` and `Asia/Kathmandu` as supported cluster time zones.\n\n ### Changes to V1 API in Rubrik version 4.0\n\n New features:\n * Added a new field 'name' on GET /sla_domain. This allows users to search\n   SLA Domains by name. Users can also sort the SLA Domain summary results\n   in ascending/descending order by name\n * The Rubrik cluster generates a unique ID for each virtual machine when a\n   vCenter Server is added. When a virtual machine changes to another vCenter\n   Server or unregisters and registers with the same vCenter Server, a new\n   unique ID is generated for that virtual machine. When this happens, the\n   virtual machine object associated with the original ID becomes a relic.\n   In this release we have added the option conflictResolutionAuthz to\n   add/edit vCenter endpoints of the Rubrik REST APIs. This option can take\n   either 'AllowAutoConflictResolution' to authorize the linking of relic\n   virtual machine objects with the current virtual machine object of a\n   specific virtual machine, and makes the collective snapshot history\n   available through the current object. Or it can take 'NoConflictResolution'\n   to not allow linking. Default value is 'NoConflictResolution'.\n * Introduced endpoints for SQL Server Live Mounts: POST /mssql/db/{id}/mount,\n   GET /mssql/db/mount, GET /mssql/db/mount/{id}, and\n   DELETE /mssql/db/mount/{id}. These allow users to create, query for, and\n   delete Live Mounts for SQL Server databases.\n * Added the isLiveMount field to the response of GET /mssql/db. Added an\n   optional is_live_mount query parameter to filter by this field.\n * Added links field to the paginated responses of\n   GET /vmware/vm, /vmware/vm/mount and /fileset endpoints. This allows users\n   to navigate between pages by following the href in links.prev and links.next.\n * Introduced optional caCerts parameter for the vCenter post/put/patch\n   endpoints to specify trusted CA certs to use when connecting to a vCenter\n   server and associated ESX hosts.\n * Modified PATCH /mssql/instance/{id} endpoint to support SQL db\n   auto-protection, added fields configuredSlaDomainId,\n   logBackupFrequencyInSeconds, logRetentionHours, and copyOnly to the PATCH\n   request, as well as configuredSlaDomainId, configuredSlaDomainName,\n   logBackupFrequencyInSeconds, logRetentionHours, and copyOnly to the GET and\n   PATCH responses.\n * Added GET /vmware/vcenter/{id} endpoint to allow fetching details of a\n   single vCenter server, including its refresh and delete status.\n * Introduced optional parameter keepMacAddresses to\n   POST /vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/mount, /vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/export, and\n   /vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/instant_recovery endpints.\n   This allows new VMs to have the same MAC address as their source VMs.\n * Introduced optional parameters offset and limit to support\n   pagination for Browse end-point.\n * Added `nodeId` to `AsyncRequestStatus` to improve debugging job failures.\n\n\n ### Changes to V1 API in Rubrik version 3.2\n\n New features:\n * Added an option to preserve the virtual machine moid during instant recovery.\n   Use this option cautiously. It will permanently overwrite the source\n   virtual machine. The source virtual machine cannot be recovered if the\n   operation fails. It will not create a new virtual machine and rename\n   the original one so we could fall back to the original in case of a failure\n   in the process. This is not exposed in the Web UI and the API user should\n   be careful to not destroy the original virtual machine by accident.\n * Introduced shareId into /fileset endpoints to support\n   the creation of filesets based on network shares.\n * Introduced optional config parameter for all on demand\n   snapshot endpoints. The config parameter includes an optional slaId field.\n   The policies of the specified SLA Domain determine the retention of backups\n   on the local Rubrik cluster, the retention target, and the archival location.\n * Introduced optional parameters to endpoint /mssql/db/{id}/export,\n   so that physical filenames and logical filenames can be changed\n   for exported databases. These two parameters are newFilename and\n   newLogicalName.\n * Introduced optional config parameter for the VM patch endpoint\n   (PATCH /vmware/vm/{id}) to specify a guest credential for a\n   specific VM.\n * Introduced optional query parameters to endpoint /host, to\n   support infix searching by hostname and sort order of results.\n * Introduced slaId and slaName field to all snapshot summary/details object.\n   These fields specify the SLA Domain object that is associated with the\n   snapshot.\n\nBug Fixes:\n * Made path parameter required in GET /fileset/snapshot/{id}/browse\n   and GET /vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/browse. Previously, an error was\n   thrown when path wasn't passed in. This solves that bug.\n\n ### Changes to V1 API in Rubrik version 3.1\n Initial GA release\n\n# Overview #\nThe Rubrik REST API provides a means to work with Rubrik clusters and Rubrik Edge virtual appliances using text-based representations of the resource objects that are managed by the Rubrik software.\n\nIn its simplest form, the RESTful architecture used by the Rubrik REST API has the following workflow:\n1. Client authenticates with the Rubrik REST API server and starts a session.\n2. Client sends an HTTP request to the URI for a resource object.\n3. Server handles the request and sends an HTTP response with a JSON formatted response body.\n\nThis overview section provides a basic description of the HTTP requests and responses used with the Rubrik REST API. The [Authentication](#section/Authentication) section provides information about how a client authenticates with the Rubrik REST API server.\n\n## Documentation conventions\n\nThe descriptions in this documentation use 'Rubrik cluster' to refer to both Rubrik clusters and Rubrik Edge virtual appliances.\n\nThe documentation uses a dollar symbol to indicate a variable in body text and code samples. Some examples:\n* `$cluster_address` to represent a Rubrik cluster IP or resolvable host name\n* `$snapshot_id` to represent the ID of a specific snapshot\n* `$request_id` to represent the ID of a specific asynchronous request\n\nTo shorten the path shown in a code sample, the documentation sometimes replaces a longer variable form with the variable form `{id}`. This variable form represents the `id` value for an associated member string in a response body or request URL.\n\nThe documentation use the term 'snappable' to refer to all objects that have data that can be protected by a Rubrik cluster or a Rubrik Edge appliance. For example, all of the following are 'snappables':\n* Virtual machines\n* File systems\n* SQL Server databases\n\n## Versioning\n\nThe Rubrik REST API structures the request URL to include the version of the API. This ensures that backwards incompatible improvements in a new version are not unintentionally used with an earlier version of the API.\n\nThe URL of a request includes a segment that identifies the version of the API. In the URL, the version segment always follows immediately after the Rubrik REST API server name or IPv4 address.\n\nFor example, for a Rubrik cluster with the server address `$cluster_address` a request to the cluster endpoint for Rubrik REST API v1 would look like this:\n`https://$cluster_address/api/v1/cluster`\n\nIn this URL, the `v1` represents the version number for Rubrik REST API v1.\n\nThe Rubrik REST API increments the version number when the new version includes a change that is not backward compatible.\n\nExamples of changes that are not backward compatible include:\n* Resource type removed\n* Required parameter added to an existing resource type\n* Required parameter removed from an existing resource type\n* Renamed resource or parameter\n* Authentication requirement added for a previously unauthenticated resource\n\nWhen the Rubrik REST API has changes that are not backward compatible, those changes appear in a new version. For example, incompatible changes to v1 appear in v2. The Rubrik REST API server makes v2 endpoints available on the path: `https://$cluster_address/api/v2/`. The Rubrik REST API server continues to provide the v1 endpoints on the path: `https://$cluster_address/api/v1/`.\n\n### Changes within a version\n\nBackward compatible changes can be added to the Rubrik REST API as part of an update of the Rubrik CDM software on a Rubrik cluster or Rubrik Edge appliance. When this occurs, the version number remains the same and the URL segment that identifies the API version does not change. The [Changelog](#section/Changelog) that is provided in the docs for each version of the Rubrik REST API describes the changes that are made within that version.\n\nExamples of backward compatible changes include:\n* New API resource added\n* New optional request parameters added to existing resources\n* New properties added to existing responses\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe Rubrik REST API architecture centers around logical entities called *resource objects*. Resource objects can be discrete entities or can contain a hierarchy of other, dependent, resource objects. A dependent, or child, resource object is referenced through the parent object.\n\nFor example, a virtualization environment is a resource object that contains virtual machines as child resource objects. The virtual machines, in turn, contain snapshots as child resource objects. To address this hierarchy, the path to a snapshot must include the parent objects.\nAs shown here those parent objects are the virtualization environment (`vmware`) and the virtual machine (`vm`): `/vmware/vm/snapshot`.\n\nWhen a request addresses a specific resource object the path must include the  `id` of that specific object.\n\nFor example, to address a specific snapshot with the `id` value of `123-456` the path would be: `/vmware/vm/snapshot/123-456`.\n\nThe full URL for the request would be: `https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot/123-456`\n\nThe path in this example points to a specific snapshot with the `id` value of `123-456`.\n\nThe `id` is an opaque value which is generated by the Rubrik REST API. It does not follow any specific format.\n\n### API base path\n\nEach endpoint in the Rubrik REST API exists on one of two possible base paths:\n* `https://$cluster_address/api/v1/`\n* `https://$cluster_address/api/internal/`\n\nThe `/api/v1` base path provides the most commonly used endpoints. Rubrik considers these endpoints to be stable. Rubrik designs new releases of the Rubrik REST API to provide as much backward compatibility for these endpoints as possible. After an upgrade to a new version of the Rubrik CDM software, or to a new version of the Rubrik REST API, existing calls to endpoints on the `/api/v1` base path will normally continue to work.\n\nThe primary purpose of the `/api/internal` base path is to provide endpoints that are used by the Rubrik cluster. These endpoints are *internal* in the sense that the Rubrik CDM software uses them to provide a wide variety of cloud data management features. The evolution and improvement of the Rubrik CDM software can cause changes to these endpoints, removal of these endpoints, or addition of new `/api/internal` endpoints. Rubrik does not attempt to make the `/api/internal` endpoints backward compatible.\n\n### Requests\n\nTo perform a task, the Rubrik REST API uses an HTTP request. Most requests perform one of these actions:\n* Get an instance of an object from a list\n* Add an instance of an object to a list\n* Perform an operation on an object using the `id` of the object.\n\nThe following table describes the HTTP method and endpoint excerpts for some typical HTTP requests.\n\n**Note:** The endpoints shown here would be appended to the base URL: `https://$cluster_address/vmware`.\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n| ------ | --- | ----------- |\n| GET | `/vm/snapshot` | Returns a list of snapshots. |\n| POST | `/vm/snapshot` | Creates a new snapshot resource object. |\n| GET | `/vm/snapshot/{id}` | Returns information about the snapshot that is identified by `id`. |\n| PATCH | `/vm/snapshot/mount/{id}` | Changes the power status of the mounted snapshot that is identified by `id`. |\n| PUT | `/vcenter/{id}` | Provides a request body with a complete update of the properties of the vCenter Server object that is identified by `id`. |\n| DELETE | `/vm/snapshot/{id}` | Deletes the snapshot that is identified by `id`. |\n| GET | `/vm/{id}/missed_snapshot` | Returns the value of `missed_snapshot` for a snapshot that is identified by `id`. |\n| POST | `/vm/snapshot/{id}/mount` | Performs a `mount` operation using the snapshot that is identified by `id`. |\n\n#### Reserved ID alias\n\nThe alias `me` can be used with some endpoints as a shorthand replacement for the current, or local, value of that resource object type. For example, for the resource object type `/cluster` the alias `me` can be substituted for the `id` of the Rubrik cluster that is hosting the current session. For the resource object type `/session` the alias `me` can be substituted for the `id` of the current session.\n\nIn filters, use the alias `local` to refer to the Rubrik cluster that is hosting the current session.\n\n#### Timestamp\n\nThe Rubrik REST API uses a timestamp to express all time values. The timestamp meets the standards of ISO 8601 and uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Timestamps take the form: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ, with YYYY for the four digit year value, MM for the two digit month value, DD for the two digit day of the month value, HH for the two digit hour value using a 24-hour clock, MM for the two digit minute value, and SS for the two digit second value. The T stands for time and the Z stands for Zulu time, another name for UTC.\n\n**Example:** Timestamp in a JSON-formatted response body\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"createdTimestamp\": \"2016-02-11T18:02:24Z\"\n}\n```\n\n### Responses\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds to all requests by sending an HTTP response message. The response contains a status code and, when appropriate, a JSON object in the response body.\n\n#### Status codes\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server includes an HTTP status code with every response. The following table describes the status codes supported by the Rubrik REST API server.\n\n| Status code | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| 200&nbsp;OK | Request succeeded. Not used for a DELETE request, or for a POST request that creates a resource. |\n| 201&nbsp;Created | POST request to create a resource object succeeded. |\n| 202&nbsp;Accepted | Request was successfully accepted for further processing. |\n| 204&nbsp;No&nbsp;Content | Request succeeded and the response body is empty. Used for successful DELETE requests and for successful POST requests that do not return content. |\n| 400&nbsp;Bad&nbsp;Request | Request failed because it was malformed. The request may be garbled, or it may be missing required parameters. |\n| 401&nbsp;Unauthorized | The requestor has insufficient authorization to perform the requested action. |\n| 403&nbsp;Forbidden | The requested action is blocked in the current context. |\n| 404&nbsp;Not&nbsp;Found | The request references a resource object that is unknown to the Rubrik REST API server. |\n| 415&nbsp;Unsupported Media Type | The HTTP header of the request specifies a media type that is not supported by the Rubrik REST API server. |\n| 422&nbsp;Unprocessable Entity | The request specifies a correct media type and contains correct syntax but cannot be processed because of semantical errors. |\n| 500&nbsp;Internal Server Error | The Rubrik REST API server encountered an unhandled error. |\n| 503&nbsp;Service Unavailable Error | The Rubrik REST API server is temporarily unavailable. |\n\n#### Response body\n\nThe JSON object included in a response body can contain members (`{string : value}`) and arrays (`[elements]`). Also, members and arrays can be nested within members and arrays.\n\nWhen a response includes a resource object, the object always includes an `id` member in the form `id : $id`. The value of the `id` member is the unique ID of the resource.\n\nWhen a response includes a large array (or list) of elements, the Rubrik REST API server encloses the array in a `ListResponse` structure. The `ListResponse` structure breaks a lengthy array into 'pages' of information to make the information easier to manage. Refer to 'Working with lists' for information about managing arrays with large numbers of values.\n\n#### Status code 400 responses\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server sends a response containing the HTTP status code '400 Bad Request' when the server cannot process the request. This can be caused by malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing.\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server returns a '400 Bad Request' when:\n* Request does not conform with the format specified in OpenAPI definition files. For example, the request is missing required fields.\n* Request is malformed. For example, the request has a malformed `id`.\n* Request contains unsupported `enum` values.\n\n#### Status code 422 responses\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server sends a response containing the HTTP status code '422 Unproccessable entity' when the request is syntactically correct but has semantic errors.\n\nFor example, when a request refers to an archival location that is not available. Although the request is properly formed, the Rubrik REST API server cannot act on the request because of the missing archival location, and the server returns '422 Unproccessable entity'.\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server also returns '422 Unproccessable entity' when invalid credentials are submitted during login. In that situation, the request may be correctly formed but the action cannot be completed by using the supplied values.\n\nThe following table describes the members of a '422 Unproccessable entity' response object.\n\n| Member | Optional | Description |\n| ------ | --- | ----------- |\n| `type` | No | Error category. Possible values include: vcenter_error, oracle_error, rubrik_error |\n| `message` | No | Plain text explanation of the cause of the error. |\n| `code` | Yes | A short text string representing the cause of the error. |\n| `param` | Yes | The request member that is the source of the error, such as `backup_window`. |\n\n## Working with lists\n\nWhen a request returns a large list of elements, the response array can be encapsulated within a `ListResponse` object. The `ListResponse` object is a pagination structure for the elements in the response array. The `ListResponse` object allows the response array to be addressed through smaller subsets of the array, or 'pages'.\n\nTo work with a `ListResponse` object, form a request that calls for a specific page of the results by specifying an offset value and a limit. The response includes the elements from the list starting at the offset value and continuing to the limit. When the limit is very large, or unspecified, the Rubrik REST API server returns as many elements as can be handled by the available memory.\n\nThe `ListResponse` object consists of the members described in the following table.\n\n| Member | Optional | Description |\n| ------ | --- | ----------- |\n| `hasMore` | No | Indicates whether the array contains elements that are not provided by the current response. `true` if more elements are available for the original request and `false` if the last element is in the current response. |\n| `data` | No | An array of the requested elements. Can be all or some of the elements requested. The elements can be members, arrays, or objects. |\n| `total` | Yes | Total number of elements. |\n| `links` | Yes | When `hasMore` is true, provides a request URL for the next page of results. When appropriate, also provides a request URL for the previous page of results. The request URLs provided by `links` retain the query parameters from the original request. For example, a request URL would retain a value specified by `limit` and a value specified by `search`. The exception to this is the value specified by `offset`, which the Rubrik REST API server uses to specify next and previous pages. |\n\nControl the contents of a `ListResponse` object by including the following optional query parameters with the original request:\n* `limit`\nDefines the maximum number of a elements to include in the `data` array of the response. Available memory may prevent the return of all elements for very large `limit` values. When that occurs, the response includes `\"hasMore\": true`.\n* `offset`\nIndex reference point to use when determining the elements to include in a response. Include the next element after the index number specified by `offset`. The default value is `0`, which means the list page that is provided in the response starts with first element in the list.\n\nFor example, if the total number of elements in response to a query are 100, and the request includes the following query parameters: `limit=10` and `offset=30`, then the response will include a list page with elements 31-40.\n\nWhen the `ListResponse` object provides `next` and `prev`, use the URL specified by `next` to request the next page of elements or use the URL specified by `prev` to request the previous page of elements.\n\n**Example:** Request for all snapshots from a Rubrik cluster\n\nThe initial request uses the query parameter `limit=1`.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot?limit=1\"\n```\n\nThe response returns the first element and `\"hasMore\": true` indicates that more than one snapshot meets the request.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": true,\n  \"status\": \"RUNNING\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"1\",\n      \"name\": \"Windows2012\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"links\": {\n    \"next\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot?limit=1&offset=1\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nTo obtain the next element, the request is reissued with the query parameters set to: `limit=1&offset=1`. This could also be achieved by using the URL specified by `next` to request the next page.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot?limit=1&offset=1\"\n```\n\nThe response returns the second element in the array. Since there are elements before and after the element in the response, the `links` member contains both a `next` request URL and a `prev` request URL.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": false,\n  \"status\": \"RUNNING\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"2\",\n      \"name\": \"Windows2016\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"links\": {\n    \"prev\": {\n       \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot?limit=1&offset=0\",\n      \"rel\": \"prev\"\n    },\n    \"next\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot?limit=1&offset=2\",\n      \"rel\": \"next\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Asynchronous requests\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server uses asynchronous (async) API requests for tasks that take longer to run. By using async requests the Rubrik REST API server avoids blocking the requestor from performing other tasks while the async tasks run.\n\nThe response to an async request includes a task object in the response body. The following table describes the members of a task object.\n\n| Member | Optional | Description |\n| ------ | --- | ----------- |\n| `id` | No |  ID assigned to the task.  |\n| `status` | No |  Status of the task: 'RUNNING', 'SUCCEEDED', 'CANCELED', or 'FAILED'.   |\n| `error` | No | Message describing reason for canceled or failed task, or 'None'. |\n| `startTime` | Yes | Timestamp when the Rubrik cluster schedules the task. |\n| `endTime` | Yes | Timestamp when the task ends. |\n| `progress` | Yes | Percentage of the task that is complete. |\n| `links` | No | Polling request array that provides information about how to poll the task. |\n\nThe following table describes the polling request array in the `links` member.\n\n| Member | Optional | Description |\n| ------ | --- | ----------- |\n| `href` | No | URL to send requests to when polling the task. |\n| `rel` | No | Provides a value of 'self' to indicate that the array refers to the resource represented by the parent JSON object. |\n\nWhen an async task is completed the Rubrik REST API server adds a second array to the `links` member in the response that is sent. The second array provides information about how to request the result of the async task.\n\nThe following table describes the results array in the `links` member.\n\n| Member | Optional | Description |\n| ------ | --- | ----------- |\n| `href` | No | URL to send a request to for the result of the task. |\n| `rel` | No | Provides a value of 'result' to indicate that the array refers to the resource represented by the parent JSON object. |\n\n**Example:** Starting a mount task and polling the task status\n\nTo initiate a mount operation, send a POST request to the mount endpoint. Include an object containing the details of the snapshot.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot/$snapshot_id/mount\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server returns a task object for the mount operation. The task object describes the task status as 'RUNNING' and provides the `links` member which contains the polling request array.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$request_id\",\n  \"status\": \"RUNNING\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/request/$request_id\",\n      \"rel\": \"self\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nUsing the information provided in the task object, send a GET request to poll the task status.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/request/$request_id\"\n```\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$request_id\",\n  \"status\": \"RUNNING\",\n  \"error\": \"None\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/request/$request_id\",\n      \"rel\": \"self\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nContinue to poll the task object until the status changes to 'SUCCEEDED'.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/request/$request_id\"\n```\n\nWhen the task object status changes to 'SUCCEEDED', the `links` member of the request includes a results array that provides a URL for the task results.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$request_id\",\n  \"status\": \"SUCCEEDED\",\n  \"error\": \"None\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/request/$request_id\",\n      \"rel\": \"self\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/$mounted_vm_id\",\n      \"rel\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n# OpenAPI\nThe Rubrik REST API specification conforms to the OpenAPI 2.0 Specification. Tools that work with the OpenAPI 2.0 Specification can be used with the Rubrik REST API specification.\n\nDevelopment releases (pre-1.0) of the Rubrik REST API specification made reference to 'swagger'. The previous release of the OpenAPI 2.0 Specification was named the Swagger 1.2 Specification.\n\nDownload the Rubrik REST API specification for your tools. [Download](./api-docs)\n\n## Rubrik REST API Explorer\nThe Rubrik REST API Explorer is a browser-based API client hosted by the Rubrik cluster. The Explorer has the Rubrik REST API specification built in. You can use the Explorer to try out Rubrik REST API calls and view the responses.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** The Explorer interacts with the Rubrik cluster through the API calls you make. Use care when making calls that modify or delete configurations and data.\n\nTo access the Rubrik REST API Explorer, click: [Rubrik REST API Explorer](./playground/)\n\n# Authentication\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server requires that all API calls use the HTTPS protocol.\nTo meet the security requirements of that protocol, the Rubrik REST API server\nuses a self-signed certificate. A Certificate Authority cannot validate a\nself-signed certificate. Configure client tools to ignore the certificate\nvalidation error.\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server requires authentication and authorization for each\nAPI call, except calls made to the following endpoints:\n\n* [/cluster/me/version](#operation/getClusterVersion)\n* [/cluster/me/api_version](#operation/getClusterApiVersion)\n\n## Authentication session\nRubrik REST API server authenticates a session using either of the following\nmethods:\n\n* BasicAuth\n* Token\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server requires that you use an authorized username and\npassword for the Rubrik cluster. Usernames are managed by either the Rubrik\ncluster or by your LDAP service.\n\n### BasicAuth authentication\n\nBasicAuth authentication uses the HTTP Basic Authentication method and requires\nyou to include the user credentials with each API call. Since each API call\nmade using the BasicAuth method is separately authenticated, you do not need\nto manage the session state. You also do not need to log out of a session,\nsince this method does not create a session.\n\nTo use the BasicAuth method, provide the user credentials in the\n'Authorization' header of an API call.\n\nUse the string `Basic` followed by the Base64 encoding of `<username:password>`\nas the user credentials, where `<username:password>` is the username for an\nAdmin account on the host Rubrik cluster, a colon, and the account password.\n\n**Example:** Using curl to retrieve a session ID\n\nThis example uses the local Admin username 'admin' and the password 'pass' to\nretrieve: a session ID, the Rubrik server software version, and the API\nversion.\n\nThe curl command shown here takes `<username:password>`, adds 'Basic ' to the\nstring, and Base64 encodes the result.\n\n The command includes the following arguments:\n * `-k` to bypass an alert about the self-signed certificate\n * `-u` to flag the `<username:password>` string\n * `-X` to flag the HTTP method `GET`\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u admin:pass -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/cluster/me\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server returns the following response body.\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$cluster_id\",\n  \"version\": \"3.1.0\",\n  \"apiVersion\": \"1.0\"\n}\n```\n\n### Token authentication\n\nToken authentication creates a token at the beginning of a session and then\nuses that token to authenticate the API calls that are made during the session.\nThe token remains valid for the session - normally 30 minutes after the last\nactivity. You can close a session and invalidate the session token at any time\nby making a DELETE call to `/session/{id}` where `{id}` is the session ID or\n`me` for the current session ID.\n\n**Example:** Token authentication in a session\n\nThis example uses the local Admin username 'admin' and the password 'pass'. To\nopen a session, first use the [BasicAuth](#section/BasicAuth) method to\nauthenticate a POST call to [/session](#operation/createSession).\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u admin:pass -X POST \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/session\"\n```\n\nThe response body includes an array with the session token.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$session_id\",\n  \"token\": \"$token_id\",\n  \"userId\": \"$user_id\"\n}\n```\nFor all subsequent calls during the session, include the token in the\nAuthorization header using the form: `Authorization: Bearer $token_id` where\n`$token_id` is the value of the `token` member from the response array.\n\nIn this curl command, the GET request to\n[/cluster](#operation/getPublicClusterInfo) uses `-H` to provide the\n`Authorization: Bearer $token_id` value.\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token_id\" -X GET\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/cluster/me\"\n```\n\nThe response body contains an array with the session ID, the Rubrik\ncluster software version, and the API version.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$cluster_id\",\n  \"version\": \"3.1.0\",\n  \"apiVersion\": \"1.0\"\n}\n```\n\nTo close the session and invalidate the session token, make a DELETE call to\n[/session](#operation/deleteSession) using the value of the `id` key or use\n`me`. The alias `me` represents the session specified in the Authorization\nheader.\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token_id\" -X DELETE\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/session/me\"\n```\n\n## LDAP Authentication\n\nThe Rubrik cluster can be integrated with an LDAP service for\nauthentication. The API endpoints provide support for adding, updating and\ndeleting a specific LDAP service as well as list all of the\nconfigured LDAP services.\n\n### Add a new LDAP service\nYou can add a new LDAP service by making a POST call to\n[/ldap_service](#operation/createLdapService). Adding a new LDAP\nservice requires information about the dynamic DNS name of the service, an\nadministrative user who is authorized to create a computer user account as\nwell as search for all the LDAP objects needed for use by the\nRubrik cluster. The Rubrik cluster resolves the dynamic DNS name using DNS\nSRV records while honoring the advertised priority values.\n\n**Example:** Adds a new LDAP service for use by the Rubrik cluster\n\nThis example adds an LDAP service that uses a dynamic DNS name\nof *example.com*, with a bind administrator user of *Administrator* with a\npassword of *VerySafe*.\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u admin:pass -X POST -d '{\"dynamicDnsName\": \"example.com\",\n  \"bindUserName\": \"Administrator\", \"bindUserPassword\": \"VerySafe\"}'\n  'https://$cluster_address/api/v1/ldap_service'\n```\n\nThe response body includes the ID associated with this LDAP service.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd\",\n  \"domainType\": \"AD\",\n  \"name\": \"example.com\",\n  \"serviceAccount\": \"cluster10-c8D7A54$\",\n  \"initialRefreshStatus\": \"ongoing\"\n}\n```\n\nThe parameters associated with the LDAP service can be updated by\nmaking a PATCH request to [/ldap_service/{id}](#operation/patchLdapService)\nor a PUT request to [/ldap_service/{id}](#operation/putLdapService).\n\nFor example, you could add a prioritized list of authentication servers that\nsupercede the LDAP servers advertised for the dynamic DNS name. These\nauthentication servers can even be proxies that connect to the actual\nLDAP servers.\n\n**Example:** Add two new LDAP services\n\nThis example adds two LDAP servers called ad-proxy1.example.com\nand ad-proxy2.cloud.example.com.\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u admin:pass -X PATCH -d '{ \"authServers\":\n[\"ldap://ad-proxy1.example.com:389\", \"ldap://ad-proxy2.example.com:389\"]}'\nhttps://$cluster_address/api/v1/ldap_service/499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd\n```\n\nThe response body confirms a successful update.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd\",\n  \"domainType\": \"AD\",\n  \"name\": \"example.com\",\n  \"initialRefreshStatus\": \"success\"\n}\n```\n\n### List configured LDAP services\nYou can get a listing of all the configured authentication domains using\na GET request to [/ldap_service](#operation/queryLdapService).\n\n**Example:** Get the list of LDAP services.\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u admin:pass -X GET 'https://$cluster_address/api/v1/ldap_service'\n```\n\nThe response body will contain the ID of all the authentication realms.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": false,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd\",\n      \"domainType\": \"AD\",\n      \"name\": \"example.com\",\n      \"serviceAccount\": \"cluster10-c8D7A54$\",\n      \"initialRefreshStatus\": \"success\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"9fef084b-75f8-4c03-9efa-c73b55be5da8\",\n      \"domainType\": \"LOCAL\",\n      \"name\": \"local\",\n      \"initialRefreshStatus\": \"success\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total\": 2\n}\n\n```\n\n### Get information about a specific LDAP service\n\nYou can also get information about a specific LDAP service using\na GET request to [/ldap_service/{id}](#operation/getLdapService).\n\n**Example:** Get information about a configured LDAP service.\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u admin:pass -X GET\n  'https://$cluster_address/api/v1/ldap_service/499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd'\n```\n\nThe response body will contain information about the specified LDAP service.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd\",\n  \"domainType\": \"AD\",\n  \"name\": \"example.com\",\n  \"serviceAccount\": \"cluster10-c8D7A54$\",\n  \"initialRefreshStatus\": \"success\"\n}\n```\n\n### Delete an LDAP service\nAny LDAP service that is configured to a Rubrik cluster can\nbe removed by issuing a DELETE request to\n[/ldap_service/{id}](#operation/deleteLdapService).\n\n**Example:** Remove an LDAP service\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u admin:pass -X DELETE\nhttps://$cluster_address/api/v1/ldap_service/499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd\n\n```\n\n## LDAP domain authentication\nScripts that automate calls to the Rubrik REST API endpoints must\ninclude one of the available authentication methods: the HTTP Basic\nmethod, the session method, or the API token method.\n\nWhen the HTTP Basic method is used, and authentication is through\nan LDAP domain, issues can arise when the Rubrik cluster is\nconfigured with multiple LDAP domains. With this method, the\nauthentication server first attempts to authenticate through the\nRubrik cluster local domain. If that authentication attempt does not\nsucceed, the authentication server attempts authentication with each\navailable LDAP domain. If there are several LDAP domains configured,\nthen this process can slow down authentication. With many LDAP\ndomains, the authentication can potentially have too many failed\nlogins and result in an account lock-out.\n\nAlthough using the [API token for authentication](#token-authentication) is recommended for\nscripting, using the session authentication method will also avoid\nthese issues. The following python script provides an example of how\nto use session authentication in a script. The method used in this\nexample can be duplicated in other scripting languages to suit your\nscripting requirements.\n\n```\ntry:\n    sessionData = None\n\n    session = requests.Session()\n    session.auth = ($username, $password)\n    session.verify = False\n    session.headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}\n    requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter()\n    session.mount('https://', requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter(pool_connections=1))\n\n    # First, login to create a Web Session Token\n    loginData = {\n       \"initParams\": {\n           \"organizationId\": $org_id\n        }\n    }\n    login = session.post(\n    url='https://{}/api/internal/session/realm/{}'.format($RubrikCluster, $domain_display_name),\n    data=json.dumps(loginData),\n    timeout=300)\n    assert login.ok and 'session' in login.json()\n    sessionData = login.json()['session']\n    session.headers.update({'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(sessionData['token'])})\n    session.auth = None\n\n    # Issue the desired request\n    cluster = session.get(url='https://{}/api/v1/cluster/me'.format($RubrikCluster))\n    assert cluster.ok\n    print('Session Auth: {}'.format(cluster.json()['name']))\n\nfinally:\n    if sessionData:\n        # Delete the web sessions explicitly. Rubrik CDM supports a\n        # limited number of sessions per user. Once this limit is exceeded,\n        # a random web session is discarded. This could log out the\n        # user from the UI or cause another script to fail.\n\n       logoutData = {\n           \"tokenIds\": [\n               sessionData['id']\n            ],\n            \"userId\": sessionData['userId']\n        }\n        logout = session.post(\n            url='https://{}/api/internal/session/bulk_delete'.format($RubrikCluster),\n            data=json.dumps(logoutData),\n            timeout=300)\n        assert logout.ok\n```\nWhere:\n    * `$username` is the name of the user account to be authenticated.\n    * `$password` is the password associated with the username.\n    * `$org_id` is the ID of the organization representing the tenant.\n    * `$RubrikCluster` is the IPv4 address or resolvable hostname of\n       the Rubrik cluster.\n    * `$domain_display_name` is the name of the LDAP domain.\n\n## SAML ID Provider Authentication\n\nThe Rubrik cluster can be integrated with a SAML ID Provider authentication\ndomain for authentication. The Rubrik REST API provides API endpoints for\nmanaging and configuring the ID Provider authentication domain with\nthe Rubrik cluster. The Rubrik REST API also provides API endpoints for\ncreating the SAML authentication request\nand handling the SAML authentication response.\n\n### Add a new SAML ID Provider Authentication Domain\nYou can add a new ID Provider by making a POST call to\n[/idp_auth_domain](#operation/createIdProviderAuthDomain).\nAdding a new ID Provider requires the ID Provider metadata XML file\nin base64 encoding, and a human-friendly name for the ID Provider.\n\n**Example:** Adds a new ID Provider for use by the Rubrik cluster\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u admin:pass -X POST -d '{\"name\": \"new-idp\",\n  \"metadataXmlBase64\": \"1VZbj6LYFn438T9UPI+mi7slpqsnm2sBQgm...\"}'\n  'https://$cluster_address/api/v1/idp_auth_domain'\n```\n\nThe response body includes the ID associated with this Active Directory.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd\",\n  \"name\": \"new-idp\",\n  \"entityId\": \"http://www.example.com/idp1\",\n  \"ssoUrl\": \"https://www.example.com/idp1/sso\",\n  \"signCert\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\nMIIDrDCCApSg...\\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\"\n}\n```\n\n### Update an existing SAML ID Provider Authentication Domain\nThe name and metadata associated with the ID Provider can be updated by\nmaking a PATCH request to\n[/idp_auth_domain/{id}](#operation/updateIdProviderAuthDomain).\nThis API call can update either of the two parameters.\n\n**Example:** Update name of the ID Provider\n\nThis example update the name of ID Provider \"new-idp\" as \"updated-idp\",\nand update metadata with new ID Provider \"http://www.example.com/idp2\"\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u admin:pass -X PATCH -d '{ \"name\": \"updated-idp\",\n  \"metadataXmlBase64\": \"1VZbj6AQwTIr4deKspU/zyR9fxqPPebgQ...\"}'\n  'https://$cluster_address/api/v1/idp_auth_domain/499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd'\n```\n\nThe response body confirms a successful update.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd\",\n  \"name\": \"updated-idp\",\n  \"entityId\": \"http://www.example.com/idp2\",\n  \"ssoUrl\": \"https://www.example.com/idp2/sso\",\n  \"signCert\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\nMIIDrDCCtchA...\\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\"\n}\n```\n\n### List configured ID Provider Authentication Domains\nYou can get a listing of all the configured ID Providers using\na GET request to [/idp_auth_domain](#operation/queryIdProviderAuthDomain).\n\n**Example:** Get the list of ID Provider authentication domains.\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u admin:pass -X GET 'https://$cluster_address/api/v1/idp_auth_domain'\n```\n\nThe response body contains the ID of all the ID provider\nauthentication domains.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": false,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd\",\n      \"name\": \"new-idp\",\n      \"entityId\": \"http://www.example.com/idp1\",\n      \"ssoUrl\": \"https://www.example.com/idp1/sso\",\n      \"signCert\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\nMIIDrDCCApSg...\\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"9fef084b-75f8-4c03-9efa-c73b55be5da8\",\n      \"name\": \"another-idp\",\n      \"entityId\": \"http://www.example.com/idp2\",\n      \"ssoUrl\": \"https://www.example.com/idp2/sso\",\n      \"signCert\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\nMIIDrDCCtchA...\\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total\": 2\n}\n\n```\n\n### Get information about a specific SAML ID Provider Authentication Domain\nYou can also get information about a specific ID Provider using\na GET request to [/idp_auth_domain/{id}](#operation/getIdProviderAuthDomain).\n\n**Example:** Get information about a configured ID Provider.\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u admin:pass -X GET\n  'https://$cluster_address/api/v1/idp_auth_domain/499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd'\n```\n\nThe response body contains information about this ID provider\nauthentication domain.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd\",\n  \"name\": \"new-idp\",\n  \"entityId\": \"http://www.example.com/idp1\",\n  \"ssoUrl\": \"https://www.example.com/idp1/sso\",\n  \"signCert\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\nMIIDrDCCApSg...\\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\"\n}\n```\n\n### Delete an ID Provider Authentication Domain\nAny ID Provider authentication domain that is configured\nto a Rubrik cluster can be removed by issuing a DELETE request to\n[/idp_auth_domain/{id}](#operation/deleteIdProviderAuthDomain).\n\n**Example:** Remove the ID Provider authentication domain\n\n```bash\ncurl -k -u admin:pass -X DELETE\nhttps://$cluster_address/api/v1/idp_auth_domain/499aeb71-f114-45a5-8456-91b9f6c45ddd\n```\n\n### Download Rubrik SAML Metadata\nGenerate the Rubrik SAML service provider metadata file and\nget the URL of the file by issuing a GET request to\n[/saml/rubrik_metadata](#operation/configRubrikSamlMetadata).\n\n**Example:**  Generate the Rubrik SAML metadata file without providing\nan address for the host at the endpoint.

data management and protection policies for their assigned snappables (virtual machines, file systems, and applications).\n\nTo provide policy based management and protection of a snappable, add the snappable to an SLA Domain, or to multiple SLA Domains.\n\n## Retrieving SLA Domains\n\nBefore assigning snappables to SLA Domains, get a list of the SLA Domains that exist on a Rubrik cluster. For a new Rubrik cluster, the list shows only the default SLA Domains. When custom SLA Domains are added to the Rubrik cluster, the list is modified to include those SLA Domains.\n\n**Example:** Retrieving SLA Domains from a Rubrik cluster\n\nSend a GET request to [`/sla_domain`](#operation/querySlaDomain).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/sla_domain\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server returns a `ListResponse` object of all SLA Domains.\nAt a minimum, the `ListResponse` object includes the default SLA Domains: Gold, Silver, and Bronze.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"$gold_sla_id\",\n      \"name\": \"Gold\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"$silver_sla_id\",\n      \"name\": \"Silver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"$bronze_sla_id\",\n      \"name\": \"Bronze\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"hasMore\": false,\n  \"total\": 3\n}\n```\n\nTo obtain more details about a specific SLA domain send a GET request with the `id` of one of the SLA Domains to the `/sla_domain/{id}` endpoint:  [`/sla_domain/{id}`](#operation/getSlaDomain)\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/sla_domain/$bronze_sla_id\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the details of the specified SLA Domain.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$bronze_sla_id\",\n  \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\",\n  \"name\": \"Bronze\",\n  \"frequencies\": [\n    {\n      \"timeUnit\": \"Daily\",\n      \"frequency\": 1,\n      \"retention\": 32\n    },\n    {\n      \"timeUnit\": \"Monthly\",\n      \"frequency\": 1,\n      \"retention\": 12\n    },\n    {\n      \"timeUnit\": \"Yearly\",\n      \"frequency\": 1,\n      \"retention\": 2\n    }\n  ],\n  \"allowedBackupWindows\": [],\n  \"firstFullAllowedBackupWindows\": [],\n  \"archivalSpecs\": [],\n  \"replicationSpecs\": [\n    {\n      \"locationId\": \"$repl_location_id\",\n      \"retentionLimit\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"numDbs\": 0,\n  \"numFilesets\": 7,\n  \"numLinuxHosts\": 3,\n  \"numWindowsHosts\": 2,\n  \"numVms\": 1,\n  \"isDefault\": false,\n  \"uiColor\": \"#cc8366\"\n}\n```\n\n## Working with SLA Domains\n\nTo work with an SLA Domain, obtain the `id` of that SLA Domain. As described in [Retrieving SLA Domains](#section/SLA-Domains/Retrieving-SLA-Domains), start by sending a GET request to [`/sla_domain`](#operation/querySlaDomain).\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with a `ListResponse` object that contains all of the SLA Domains on the specfied Rubrik cluster. From that list object, find the data array element that has the `name` value of the selected SLA Domain. In the same array element as the `name` value, note the value of the `id` string.\n\n## Creating SLA Domains\n\nTo create an SLA domain send a POST request to [`/sla_domain`](#operation/createSlaDomain). Include the attributes for the SLA Domain in the request body.\n\nThe following table describes the required and optional attributes to include in the request body when creating an SLA Domain.\n\n| Attribute | Req'd | JSON Type | Description |\n| ------ | --- | ----- | ----------- |\n| `name` | Yes | String | Name of the SLA Domain.  |\n| `frequencies` | Yes | Array | Each member defines a policy by specifying: `timeUnit`, `frequency`, and `retention`. Requires at least one member in the array.  |\n| `allowedBackupWindows` | Yes | Array | Each member defines a backup window using values for `startTimeAttributes` and `durationInHours`. The time specified in `startTimeAttributes` uses the Rubrik cluster time zone. To specify multiple backup windows, add an array member for each window. To create an SLA Domain without a backup window, specify a null array value: `[]`.  |\n| `firstFullAllowedBackupWindows` | Yes | Array | Each member defines a period when first full backups are allowed by specifying: `startTimeAttributes` and `durationInHours`. Several first full backup windows can be specified by adding an array member for each one. Create an SLA Domain without a first full backup window by specifying a null array value: `[]`.  |\n| `localRetentionLimit` | No | String | Specify an integer value to set the number of days to retain a local copy of a snapshot. When an archival location is specified, specify `0` to enable Instant Archiving. |\n| `archivalSpecs` | No | Array | Defines the archival location for the SLA Domain by specifying: `locationId` and `archivalThreshold`. Currently limited to one array member. |\n| `replicationSpecs` | No | Array | Defines the replication location for the SLA Domain by specifying: `locationId` and `retentionLimit`. Currently limited to one array member. |\n\n**Example:** Creating an SLA Domain for daily backups\n\nCreate an SLA Domain that takes a backup once a day and retains the backup for seven days. Do not set a backup window or a first full backup window. Do not include archival or replication.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n  \"name\": \"Daily SLA\",\n  \"frequencies\": [\n    {\n      \"timeUnit\": \"Day\",\n      \"frequency\": 1,\n      \"retention\": 7\n    }\n  ],\n  \"allowedBackupWindows\": [],\n  \"firstFullAllowedBackupWindows\": [] }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/sla_domain\"\n```\nThe response confirms the attributes of the SLA Domain and provides the `id` of the new SLA Domain.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$sla_id\",\n  \"name\": \"Daily SLA\",\n  \"frequencies\": [\n    {\n      \"timeUnit\": \"Day\",\n      \"frequency\": 1,\n      \"retention\": 7\n    }\n  ],\n  \"allowedBackupWindows\": [],\n  \"firstFullAllowedBackupWindows\": []\n}\n```\n## Modifying SLA Domains\n\nTo modify the attributes of an SLA domain send a PUT request to [`/sla_domain/{id}`](#operation/updateSlaDomain). Include in the request body the new attributes.\n\n**Example:** Modifying the daily backup SLA Domain\n\nChange the SLA Domain that was created in [Creating SLA Domains](#section/SLA-Domains/Creating-SLA-Domains) to increase the retention to 14 days.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT \\\n  -d '{\n  \"name\": \"Daily SLA\",\n  \"frequencies\": [\n    {\n      \"timeUnit\": \"Day\",\n      \"frequency\": 1,\n      \"retention\": 14\n    }\n  ],\n  \"allowedBackupWindows\": [],\n  \"firstFullAllowedBackupWindows\": [] }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/sla_domain/$sla_id\"\n```\nThe response confirms the new attribute.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$sla_id\",\n  \"name\": \"Daily SLA\",\n  \"frequencies\": [\n    {\n      \"timeUnit\": \"Day\",\n      \"frequency\": 1,\n      \"retention\": 14\n    }\n  ],\n  \"allowedBackupWindows\": [],\n  \"firstFullAllowedBackupWindows\": []\n}\n```\n## Patching SLA Domains\n\nTo patch the attributes of an SLA domain, send a PATCH request to\n[`/sla_domain/{id}`](#operation/patchSlaDomain). Include in the request body\nonly the attributes that needs to be patched.\n\n**Example:** Patching the daily backup SLA Domain\n\nPatch the SLA Domain that was created in [Creating SLA Domains]\n(#section/SLA-Domains/Creating-SLA-Domains) to change the archival\nspecifications.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X PATCH \\\n  -d '{\n  \"archivalSpecs\": [\n    {\n        \"locationId\": \"some-valid-archived-location-id\",\n        \"archivalThreshold\": 14\n    }\n  ]}' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/sla_domain/$sla_id\"\n```\nThe response confirms the new attribute and also includes the other\nattributes that were not changed.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$sla_id\",\n  \"name\": \"Daily SLA\",\n  \"frequencies\": [\n    {\n      \"timeUnit\": \"Day\",\n      \"frequency\": 1,\n      \"retention\": 7\n    }\n  ],\n  \"archivalSpecs\": [\n    {\n      \"locationId\": \"some-valid-archived-location-id\",\n      \"archivalThreshold\": 14\n    }\n  ],\n  \"allowedBackupWindows\": [],\n  \"firstFullAllowedBackupWindows\": []\n}\n```\n## Deleting SLA Domains\n\nTo delete an SLA domain send a DELETE request to [`/sla_domain/{id}`](#operation/deleteSlaDomain).\n\n**Example:** Deleting an SLA Domain\n\nDelete an SLA Domain with the `id` of `$sla_id`.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/sla_domain/$sla_id\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with HTTP response code 204. This indicates the request succeeded and the response body is empty.\n\n## Inherited protection\n\nThe Rubrik REST API uses the reserved value `INHERIT` with the `configuredSlaDomainId` string to identify a snappable that derives its protection policy from a parent object. Examples of this:\n* VMware virtual machine inherits from vCenter Server\n* SQL Server database inherits from SQL Server instance\n\nEvery snappable that can be protected through an SLA Domain is represented by an object that has a `configuredSlaDomainId` attribute and an `effectiveSlaDomainId` attribute. The `configuredSlaDomainId` attribute contains either the value of a direct SLA Domain assignment or the reserved value `INHERIT`.\n\nThe `effectiveSlaDomainId` attribute contains the value of the SLA Domain setting that the Rubrik cluster actually applies to the snappable. When the value of the `configuredSlaDomainId` attribute is `INHERIT`, the value of the `effectiveSlaDomainId` attribute is derived from a parent object of the snappable. In all other cases, the value of the `effectiveSlaDomainId` attribute is the same as the value of the `configuredSlaDomainId` attribute.\n\n\n## SLA Domain assignments\n\nTo assign a snappable to an SLA Domain, use the endpoint that is provided for that type of snappable.\n* VMware virtual machines  \nSend a PATCH request to  [`/vmware/vm/{id}`](#operation/updateVm).

The Rubrik cluster also works with\nthe Rubrik Backup Service running on the virtual machine to provide:\n\n* Optimal performance when restoring files and folders to the virtual machine\n* Application consistent snapshots of a Windows virtual machine\n\n\n## vCenter servers\n\nA Rubrik cluster normally protects and manages virtual machines through the vCenter Server that administers those virtual machines. After a vCenter server is added to a Rubrik cluster, the Rubrik cluster automatically discovers the virtual machines that are administered by that vCenter server.\n\n### Retrieving vCenter Servers\n\nRequest a list of the vCenter servers that are registered with a Rubrik cluster by sending a GET request to  [`/vmware/vcenter`](#operation/queryVcenter).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the first page of a `ListResponse` object.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": false,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"$vcenter_id0\",\n      \"hostname\": \"$vcenter_address0\",\n      \"username\": \"$vcenter_admin0\",\n      \"configuredSlaDomainId\": \"INHERIT\",\n      \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\",\n      \"caCerts\": \"$ca_certs0\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"$vcenter_id1\",\n      \"hostname\": \"$vcenter_address1\",\n      \"username\": \"$vcenter_admin1\",\n      \"configuredSlaDomainId\": \"INHERIT\",\n      \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\",\n      \"caCerts\": \"$ca_certs1\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total\": 2\n}\n```\nDepending on the number of registered vCenter Servers, all of the entries on the list may not be included on the first page. [Working with lists](#section/Overview/Working-with-lists) describes how to work with a ListResponse object to obtain additional pages of the list.\n\n\n### Adding a vCenter server\n\nTo add a vCenter server, send a POST request to [`/vmware/vcenter`](#operation/createVcenter).\nInclude in the body of the request the address of the vCenter server and credentials for a user account (`username`) that has the required permissions. The Rubrik User Guide provides details about creating an account with the required permissions.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    \"hostname\": \"$vcenter_address\",\n    \"username\": \"$vcenter_admin\",\n    \"password\": \"$vcenter_password\" }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server initiates the asynchronous request task and responds with a task object.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$request_id\",\n  \"status\": \"RUNNING\",\n  \"error\": \"None\",\n  \"progress\": \"$request_progress\"\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      href: \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter/request/$request_id\",\n      rel: \"self\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nUsing the information provided in the task object, send a GET request to the [`/vmware/vcenter/request/{id}`](#operation/getVcenterAsyncRequestStatus) endpoint to poll the task status. When the value of `status` in the task object is `SUCCEEDED`, the task finished successfully.\n\n### Retrieve vCenter Server details\nGet the details for a vCenter Server that is registered with a Rubrik cluster by sending a GET request to [`/vmware/vcenter/{id}`](#operation/getVcenter).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter/{id}\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the details of the specified vCenter Server object.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$id\",\n  \"hostname\": \"$vcenter_address0\",\n  \"username\": \"$vcenter_admin0\",\n  \"configuredSlaDomainId\": \"INHERIT\",\n  \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\"\n}\n```\n\n### Modifying a vCenter Server entry\n\nTo change the information that a Rubrik cluster stores for a vCenter Server, send a PUT request to [`/vmware/vcenter/{id}`](#operation/updateVcenter). All of the members of the `VcenterConfig` object must be in the PUT request. Using the new values, include in the body of the PUT request each member (`{string : value}`) of the `VcenterConfig` object:\n* `\"hostname\": \"$vcenter_address\"`\n* `\"username\": \"$vcenter_admin\"`\n* `\"password\": \"$vcenter_password\"`\n\nTo change the configured SLA that is configured for a vCenter Server or to change CA certificates for the vCenter, send a PATCH request to[`/vmware/vcenter/{id}`](#operation/patchVcenter).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT \\\n  -d '{\n    \"hostname\": \"$vcenter_address\",\n    \"username\": \"$vcenter_admin\",\n    \"password\": \"$vcenter_password\" }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter/$vcenter_id\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server sends a response, with the updated details of the vCenter Server entry in the response body.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$vcenter_id\",\n  \"hostname\": \"$vcenter_address\",\n  \"username\": \"$vcenter_admin\",\n  \"configuredSlaDomainId\": \"INHERIT\",\n  \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\",\n  \"caCerts\": \"$ca_certs\"\n}\n```\n### Removing a vCenter Server entry\n\nTo remove a vCenter Server entry from a Rubrik cluster, first unmount any Live Mount and Instant Recovery virtual machines for the vCenter Server. Then send a DELETE request to [`/vmware/vcenter/{id}`](#operation/deleteVcenter).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter/$vcenter_id\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server initiates the asynchronous delete task and responds with a task object.\n\n```bash\n{\n    \"id\": \"$request_id\",\n    \"status\": \"RUNNING\",\n    \"error\": \"None\",\n    \"progress\": 0,\n    \"startTime\": \"$start_timestamp\",\n    \"endTime\": \"$end_timestamp\",\n    \"links\": [\n      {\n        \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter/request/$request_id\",\n        \"rel\": \"self\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n```\nUsing the information provided in the task object, send a GET request to poll the task status. When the value of `status` in the task object is `SUCCEEDED`, the removal of the vCenter Server object finished successfully.\n\n### Force refresh of virtual machine on a vCenter\nForce a refresh of the metadata for a single virtual machine by sending a POST\nrequest to [`/vmware/vcenter/{id}`](#operation/createRefreshVmV1).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    \"vmMoid\": \"$vm_moid\" }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter/{id}/refresh_vm\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with a 204 response.\n\n\n\n### Metadata refresh\n\nThe Rubrik cluster regularly refreshes the metadata of the registered vCenter Servers. As part of a refresh operation, the Rubrik cluster discovers any changes or additions to the virtual machines that are administered by the vCenter Servers. Instead of waiting for a regular refresh, a metadata refresh can be manually initiated by sending a POST request to [`/vmware/vm/refresh`](#operation/createRefresh), using the Rubrik cluster ID (`$cluster_address`) and the vCenter Server ID (`$vcenter_id`).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter/$vcenter_id/refresh\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server initiates the asynchronous request task and responds with a task object.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$request_id\",\n  \"status\": \"RUNNING\",\n  \"error\": \"None\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter/request/$request_id\",\n      \"rel\": \"self\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nUsing the information provided in the task object, send a GET request to poll the task status. When the value of `status` in the task object is `SUCCEEDED`, the metadata refresh completed successfully.\n\n## ESXi hypervisors\n\nRetrieve a list of all available ESXi hypervisors in the vSphere environment by sending a GET request to [`/vmware/host`](#operation/queryVmwareHost).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/host?primary_cluster_id=$cluster_id\"\n```\nThe value of `primary_cluster_id` is the `id` of a Rubrik cluster. Use `local` to retrieve a list for the Rubrik cluster that is hosting the current session.\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the first page of a `ListResponse` object.\n\n**Note:** To shorten the example, the response uses ellipsis to replace some members.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": false,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"$esxi_id\",\n      \"name\": \"$esxi_name\",\n      \"datacenterId\": \"$datacenter_id\",\n      \"computeClusterId\": \"$compute_cluster_id\",\n      \"datastores\": [\n      ...\n      ],\n      \"configuredSlaDomainId\": \"INHERIT\",\n      \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\"\n    }\n    ],\n  \"total\": 1\n}\n```\n\nRetrieve more details for an ESXi hypervisor by sending a GET request to [`/vmware/host/{id}`](#operation/getVmwareHost)\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/host/$esxi_id\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the details for the specified ESXi hypervisor.\n\n**Note:** To shorten the example, the response uses ellipsis to replace some members.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$esxi_id\",\n  \"moid\": \"$moid\",\n  \"name\": \"$esxi_name\",\n  \"computeClusterId\": \"$compute_cluster_id\",\n  \"datacenter\": {\n    \"id\": \"$datacenter_id\",\n    \"name\": \"$datacenter_name\",\n    \"vcenterId\": \"$vcenter_id\",\n    \"configuredSlaDomainId\": \"INHERIT\",\n    \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\"\n  },\n  \"datastores\": [\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"virtualMachines\": [\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"configuredSlaDomainId\": \"INHERIT\",\n  \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\"\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, To change the SLA Domain that is configured for an ESXi hypervisor, send a PATCH request on [`/vmware/host`](#operation/updateVmwareHost)\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/host/$snapshot_id\"\n```\n\nRetrieve datastore details for an ESXi hypervisor by sending a GET request to [`/vmware/host/{id}/datastore`](#operation/getVmwareHostDatastore)\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/host/$esxi_id/datastore\"\n```\n\n\n## Virtual machine protection\n\nAfter a vCenter Server is registered, the Rubrik cluster acquires metadata for the virtual machines that are administered through that vCenter Server. Using the metadata, assign Rubrik cluster protection to the virtual machines.\n\nThe typical protection workflow involves the following tasks:\n1. Find the virtual machine resource object.\n2. (Optional) Enable scripts on the virtual machine.\n3. (Optional) Exclude specified vmdk files for the virtual machine.\n4. Assign the virtual machine to an SLA Domain.\n5. (Optional) Get the configuration used to force a full snapshot of the\n   virtual machine.\n6. (Optional) Request a forced full snapshot for the virtual machine.\n\n### Finding virtual machines\nGet a list of the virtual machine objects known to the Rubrik cluster by sending a GET request to [`/vmware/vm`](#operation/queryVm). The Rubrik REST API server returns a response that includes a `ListResponse` object. Use query parameters as part of the GET request, to filter the list and to work with the `ListResponse` object.\n\nA GET request that is sent to the [`/vmware/vm`](#operation/queryVm) endpoint accepts the query parameters that are described in the following table.\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --------- | ----------- |\n| `effective_sla_domain_id` | SLA Domain applied to the virtual machine, either directly or derived. Use `UNPROTECTED` for virtual machines that do not have a derived or direct SLA Domain. |\n| `primary_cluster_id` | The `id` of the primary Rubrik cluster for the virtual machine. Use `local` for the Rubrik cluster that is hosting the Rubrik REST API session. |\n| `limit` | Maximum number of a elements to include in the `data` array of the response. |\n| `offset` | Index reference point to use when determining the elements to include in the response. |\n| `is_relic` | Relic status of the virtual machine. `true` to specify only relic virtual machines. `false` to exclude relic virtual machines. Do not include the parameter to include both relic and non-relic virtual machines. |\n| `name` | String value to match in any part of the name of a virtual machine.  |\n| `moid` | String value to match in any part of the MOID of a virtual machine.  |\n| `sla_assignment` | SLA Domain assignment status of the virtual machine. Use `derived` for virtual machines that derive protection status from another resource object. Use `direct` for virtual machines that have a directly assigned SLA Domain. Use `unassigned` for virtual machines that do not have a direct or derived SLA Domain. |\n| `guest_os_name` | Filter by vm guest os name using infix search. |\n| `sort_by` | Perform an ASCII sort of the elements in the `ListResponse` object data array by a specified object value: `effective_sla_domain_id`, `name`, `moid`, `folderPath`, or `infraPath`. |\n| sort_order | Sort order for the elements in the ListResponse object data array. Use `asc` for ascending sort or `desc` for descending sort. |\n\n\n**Example:** Retrieving a list of virtual machine resource objects\n\nRetrieve a list of unprotected virtual machine resource objects that have 'test' in their name. Limit the first page of the response to the first object.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm?effective_sla_domain_id=UNPROTECTED&limit=1&offset=0&name=test\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with a `ListResponse` object. The first page has the first object of the 156 objects that matched the query parameters.\n\n**Note:** To shorten the example, the response uses ellipsis to replace some members.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": true,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"$vm_id\",\n      \"moid\": \"$vm_moid\",\n      \"name\": \"abctest123\",\n      \"vcenterId\": \"$vcenter_id\",\n      \"hostName\": \"$esxi_host_name\",\n      \"hostId\": \"$esxi_host_id\",\n      \"clusterName\": \"$vcenter_cluster_name\",\n      \"powerStatus\": \"poweredOn\",\n      \"configuredSlaDomainId\": \"INHERIT\",\n      \"configuredSlaDomainName\": \"Inherit\",\n      \"effectiveSlaDomainId\": \"UNPROTECTED\",\n      \"effectiveSlaDomainName\": \"Unprotected\",\n      \"slaAssignment\": \"Unassigned\",\n      \"ipAddress\": \"$vm_ip\",\n      \"toolsInstalled\": true,\n      \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\",\n      \"isReplicationEnabled\": false,\n      \"folderPath\": [\n        ...\n      ],\n      \"infraPath\": [\n        ...\n      ],\n      \"vmwareToolsInstalled\": true,\n      \"isRelic\": false,\n      \"maxNestedVsphereSnapshots\": -1,\n      \"snapshotConsistencyMandate\": \"UNKNOWN\",\n      \"physicalStorage\": 0,\n      \"guestCredentialAuthorizationStatus\": \"PENDING\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total\": 156\n}\n```\n\n### Retrieving more details for a virtual machine\nTo get detailed information for a specified virtual machine object, send a GET request to [`/vmware/vm/{id}`](#operation/getVm).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/$vm_id\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the details for the virtual machine object.\n\n**Note:** To shorten the example, the response uses ellipsis to replace some members.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$vm_id\",\n  \"moid\": \"$vm_moid\",\n  \"name\": \"abctest123\",\n  \"powerStatus\": \"poweredOn\",\n  \"configuredSlaDomainId\": \"INHERIT\",\n  \"effectiveSlaDomain\": {\n    ...\n  },\n  \"slaAssignment\": \"Unassigned\",\n  \"blackoutWindowStatus\": {\n    \"isGlobalBlackoutActive\": false,\n    \"isSnappableBlackoutActive\": false\n  },\n  \"blackoutWindows\": {\n    ...\n    ],\n    \"snappableBlackoutWindows\": []\n  },\n  \"currentHost\": {\n    ...\n  },\n  \"virtualDiskIds\": [\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"snapshots\": [],\n  \"ipAddress\": \"$vm_ip\",\n  \"toolsInstalled\": true,\n  \"snapshotCount\": 0,\n  \"snapshotConsistencyMandate\": \"\",\n  \"maxNestedVsphereSnapshots\": -1,\n  \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\",\n  \"isReplicationEnabled\": false,\n  \"isRelic\": false,\n  \"physicalStorage\": 0,\n  \"guestOsName\": \"$guest_os\",\n  \"guestCredentialAuthorizationStatus\": \"PENDING\",\n  \"isArrayIntegrationPossible\": false,\n  \"isArrayIntegrationEnabled\": false\n}\n```\n\n### Register Rubrik Backup Service\n\nTo register Rubrik Backup Service running on a specified virtual machine,\nsend a POST request to\n[`/vmware/vm/{id}/register_agent`](#operation/vmRegisterAgent).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/$vm_id/register_agent\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with an HTTP 204 response when the\nregistration is successful.\n\n\n### Enabling scripts\n\nA virtual machine object can be configured to start scripts on the guest operating system. A script can be started before the backup (`preBackupScript`), after the snapshot completes (`postSnapScript`), and after the backup task completes (`postBackupScript`). The *Rubrik User Guide* provides information about script requirements.\n\nTo configure a virtual machine object to start scripts, send a PATCH request to [`/vmware/vm/{id}`](#operation/updateVm). Since this is a PATCH request, only the elements of the virtual machine object that are modified or added should be included in the request body. All three script members are shown in the request body in this model, but all are optional.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X PATCH \\\n -d '{\n      \"preBackupScript\": {\n        \"scriptPath\": \"$pre_script_path\",\n        \"timeoutMs\": 10000,\n        \"failureHandling\": \"abort\"\n      },\n      \"postSnapScript\": {\n        \"scriptPath\": \"$postsnap_script_path\",\n        \"timeoutMs\": 10000,\n        \"failureHandling\": \"abort\"\n      },\n      \"postBackupScript\": {\n        \"scriptPath\": \"$postbackup_script_path\",\n        \"timeoutMs\": 10000,\n        \"failureHandling\": \"abort\"\n      }\n    }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/$vm_id\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server sends an HTTP 200 response that includes the modified or added members in the response body.\n\n#### Manually starting a virtual machine script\n\nFor testing or to run a script before running a backup, manually trigger the script by sending a POST request to [`/vmware/vm/{id}/guest_script/run`](#operation/runGuestOsScript). To manually start a script, the script must first be a part of the configuration of the virtual machine object. Use the value of the `phase` member to identify the script, as follows:\n* Use `PreBackup` for the script identified by the `preBackupScript` member.\n* Use `PostSnap` for the script identified by the `postSnapScript` member.\n* Use `PostBackup` for the script identified by the `postBackupScript` member.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    \"phase\": \"PreBackup\" }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/$vm_id/guest_script/run\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with an HTTP 204 response when the script finishes with a 0 exit code.\n\n\n### Excluding a VMDK file\n\nThe Rubrik cluster can be configured to ignore some of the VMDK files of a virtual machine while protecting the other VMDK files of that virtual machine. To exclude a VMDK file, send a GET request to [`/vmware/vm/virtual_disk/{id}`](#operation/getVirtualDisk) using the `$disk_id` of the VMDK file.\n\nTo get the `$disk_id` values, send a GET request to [`/vmware/vm/{id}`](#operation/getVm).

Retrieve missed snapshot information for a virtual machine by sending  a GET request to [`/vmware/vm/{id}/missed_snapshot`](#operation/missedSnapshots).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/$vm_id/missed_snapshot\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with a `ListResponse` object.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": false,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"archivalLocationType\": [\n        \"missed\"\n      ],\n      \"missedSnapshotTime\": \"$timestamp0\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"archivalLocationType\": [\n        \"missed\"\n      ],\n      \"missedSnapshotTime\": \"$timestamp1\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total\": 2\n}\n```\n\n### Creating on-demand snapshots\n\nOn-demand snapshots can be created for both protected and unprotected virtual machines. To create an on-demand snapshot of a virtual machine send a POST request to [`/vmware/vm/{id}/snapshot`](#operation/createOnDemandBackup).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/$vm_id/snapshot\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server initiates the asynchronous snapshot task and responds with a task object.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$request_id\",\n  \"status\": \"ACQUIRING\",\n  \"progress\": 0,\n  \"startTime\": \"$timestamp\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/request/$request_id\",\n      \"rel\": \"self\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nUsing the information provided in the task object, send a GET request to poll the task status. When the value of `status` in the task object is `SUCCEEDED`, the on-demand snapshot finished successfully.\n\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/request/$request_id\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server sends a task object with `status=\"SUCCEEDED\"`.  The task object for a successful snapshot includes the URI for the snapshot: `https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot/$snapshot_id`.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\":\"$request_id\",\n  \"status\":\"SUCCEEDED\",\n  \"startTime\":\"$timestamp0\",\n  \"endTime\":\"$timestamp1\",\n  \"links\":[\n    {\n      \"href\":\"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot/$snapshot_id\",\n      \"rel\":\"result\"\n    },\n   {\n      \"href\":\"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/request/$request_id\",\n      \"rel\":\"self\"\n   }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Expiring individual snapshots\n\nOn-demand snapshots and snapshots for unprotected virtual machines can be expired by using the snapshot `id`. To expire an individual snapshot, send a DELETE request to [`/vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}`](#operation/deleteVmwareSnapshot). Include the query parameter `location` to specify whether to expire all copies of the snapshot, or only the local copy. Use `location=local` to expire only the copy of the snapshot on the specified Rubrik cluster. Use `location=all` to expire all copies of the snapshot, including replicas and archival copies.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot/$snapshot_id?location=$snapshot_location\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server expires the specified snapshot and responds with HTTP response code 204. This indicates the request succeeded and the response body is empty.\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with HTTP response code 422 'Unprocessable Entity', when the specified snapshot is not one of the following:\n* On-demand snapshot\n* Snapshot for an unprotected virtual machine\n\n### Expiring all snapshots for a virtual machine\n\nAll snapshots for an unprotected virtual machine can be expired by using the virtual machine `id`. To expire all snapshots for an unprotected virtual machine, send a DELETE request to [`/vmware/vm/{id}/snapshot`](#operation/deleteVmwareSnapshots). The Rubrik cluster expires all snapshots, replicas, and archival snapshots for the specified virtual machine.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/$vm_id/snapshot\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server expires all snapshots for the specified virtual machine in all locations and responds with HTTP response code 204. This indicates the request succeeded and the response body is empty.\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with HTTP response code 422 'Unprocessable Entity', when the specified virtual machine is protected through an SLA Domain assignment.\n\n\n\n\n## Data recovery\nTo recover a file or folder from a snapshot, retrieve the `id` of the file or folder using either search or browse. Then use the `id` with one of the recovery methods:\n* Download the file or folder\n* Restore the file or folder to the source location\n* Export the file or folder to another host\n\n### Searching for data in snapshots\n\nSearch for files and folders across all indexed snapshots of a virtual machine by using the virtual machine `id`. Send a GET request to [`/vmware/vm/{id}/search`](#operation/searchVm) with the `path` query parameter. Use a path segment string or a name segment string for the value of `path`.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** The snapshot used in this task must be indexed. Indexing makes the file system structure of the data available to the Rubrik cluster. To determine whether a snapshot has been successfully indexed, send a GET request to [`/vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}`](#operation/getSnapshot) as described in the 'Retrieving snapshot information' section of [Snapshot management](#section/Virtual-machines/Snapshot-management). Look at the value of `indexState`. A value of `1` means the snapshot has been indexed. A value of `0` means the snapshot has not been indexed.\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server uses the rules described in the following table when matching the value of `path` with folders and files in the indexed snapshots.\n| Type | Rule | Description |\n| ---- | ---- | ----------- |\n| Path delimiter | Forward slashes and backslashes are equally recognized as path delimiters. | In the value of path, `/` matches both `/` and `\\`, and `\\` matches both `/` and `\\`. |\n| Path segments | Path segments match all files and folders that begin with the same path segment. | For example, '/abc/x' matches files and folders at '/abc/' or '\\abc\\\\' with a filename or folder name that starts with 'x'. |\n| Name segments | Name segments match all files and folders that begin with the same name segment. | For example, 'xyz' matches files and folders with a filename or folder name that starts with 'xyz', in all path locations. |\n| Characters | Any character that the guest operating system accepts in a file path can be used.  | For example, the greater than symbol `>` and the lesser than symbol `<` are not allowed. |\n| Windows drive | To specify a full path on a Windows guest follow the Windows file system requirement. | For example, to specify the 'temp' folder on the 'D' drive of a Windows virtual machine, use: `D:\\temp`. |\n\n**Example:** Searching for files and folders\n\nSearch for all files and folders in '/usr/local/' with a name that starts with the later 'g'.\n\nSend a GET request to [`/vmware/vm/{id}/search`](#operation/searchVm) with `path=/usr/local/g`.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/$vm_id/search?path=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fg\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with a `ListResponse` object. The data array has two members, a directory at: `/usr/local/games` and a file at: `/usr/local/gamehints`.\n\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": false,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/usr/local/games\",\n      \"filename\": \"games\",\n      \"fileVersions\": [\n        {\n          \"lastModified\": \"$timestamp0\",\n          \"size\": 4096,\n          \"snapshotId\": \"$snapshot_id0\",\n          \"fileMode\": \"directory\",\n          \"source\": \"cloud\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n    \"path\": \"/usr/local/gamehints\",\n    \"filename\": \"gamehints\",\n    \"fileVersions\": [\n      {\n        \"lastModified\": \"$timestamp1\",\n        \"size\": 14480,\n        \"snapshotId\": \"$snapshot_id1\",\n        \"fileMode\": \"file\",\n        \"source\": \"cloud\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"lastModified\": \"$timestamp2\",\n        \"size\": 14480,\n        \"snapshotId\": \"$snapshot_id2\",\n        \"fileMode\": \"file\",\n        \"source\": \"cloud\"\n      }\n    ]\n   }\n  ],\n  \"total\": 2\n}\n```\n\n### Browsing for data in snapshots\n\nBrowse for files and folders with an indexed snapshot by using the snapshot `id`. Send a GET request to  [`/vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/browse`](#operation/browseVmwareSnapshot) with the `path` query parameter.  Use a path segment string for the value of `path`. The response provides a ListResponse object that includes all of the files and folders in the directory that is specified by the value of `path`.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** The snapshot used in this task must be indexed. Indexing makes the file system structure of the data available to the Rubrik cluster. To determine whether a snapshot has been successfully indexed, send a GET request to [`/vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}`](#operation/getSnapshot) as described in the 'Retrieving snapshot information' section of [Snapshot management](#section/Virtual-machines/Snapshot-management). Look at the value of `indexState`. A value of `1` means the snapshot has been indexed. A value of `0` means the snapshot has not been indexed.\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server uses the rules described in the following table when matching the value of `path` with the path in the specified snapshot.\n| Type | Rule | Description |\n| ---- | ---- | ----------- |\n| Path delimiter | Forward slashes and backslashes are equally recognized as path delimiters. | In the value of path, `/` matches both `/` and `\\`, and `\\` matches both `/` and `\\`. |\n| Path description | The path description must end in a directory name, without an ending slash. | For example, '/abc/x' returns all files and folders in the directory at '/abc/x', but '/abc/x/' returns an HTTP 422 response. |\n| Characters | Any character that the guest operating system accepts in a file path can be used.  | For example, the greater than symbol `>` and the lesser than symbol `<` are not allowed. |\n| Windows drive | To specify a full path on a Windows guest follow the Windows file system requirement. | For example, to specify the 'temp' folder on the 'D' drive of a Windows virtual machine, use: `D:\\temp`. |\n\n**Example:** Browsing for files and folders\n\nRetrieve a ListResponse object with all of the files and folders in '/home'.\n\nSend a GET request to  [`/vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/browse`](#operation/browseVmwareSnapshot) with `path=/home`.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot/$snapshot_id/browse?path=%2Fhome&offset=0\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with a `ListResponse` object. The data array has two members, the directory: `ubuntu` and the file: `ubuntu.tar`.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": false,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"filename\": \"ubuntu\",\n      \"path\": \"ubuntu\",\n      \"lastModified\": \"$timestamp0\",\n      \"size\": 31892819777,\n      \"fileMode\": \"directory\",\n      \"statusMessage\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"filename\": \"ubuntu.tar\",\n      \"path\": \"ubuntu.tar\",\n      \"lastModified\": \"$timestamp1\",\n      \"size\": 4746675383,\n      \"fileMode\": \"file\",\n      \"statusMessage\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total\": 2\n}\n```\n### Downloading data from a snapshot\n\nData can be retrieved from a snapshot by creating a download link for an individual file and folder from the snapshot. To have the Rubrik cluster create a download link, send a POST request to [`/vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/download`](#operation/createDownloadFileJob). Include in the request body the string/value pair: `\"path\":\"$path\"`, where `$path` is the full path to the file or folder. When `$path` refers to a folder, the Rubrik cluster creates a ZIP file of the folder and all that it contains.\n\nThe basic download work flow is:\n1. Send a POST request to start the asynchronous download task.\n2. Send a GET request to poll the task status.\n3. When the task succeeds, use the download link provided in the response body to retrieve the file or folder.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** The snapshot used in this task must be indexed. Indexing makes the file system structure of the data available to the Rubrik cluster. To determine whether a snapshot has been successfully indexed, send a GET request to [`/vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}`](#operation/getSnapshot) as described in the 'Retrieving snapshot information' section of [Snapshot management](#section/Virtual-machines/Snapshot-management). Look at the value of `indexState`. A value of `1` means the snapshot has been indexed. A value of `0` means the snapshot has not been indexed.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -d \\\n'{\n   \"path\": \"$full_source_path\"\n }' \\\n 'https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot/$snapshot_id/download_file'\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server initiates the asynchronous request task and responds with a task object.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$download_task_id\",\n  \"status\": \"QUEUED\",\n  \"progress\": 0,\n  \"startTime\": \"$timestamp\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter/request/$request_id\",\n      \"rel\": \"self\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Restoring data from a snapshot\n\nTo restore a file or folder to the source virtual machine send a POST request to [`/vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/restore_file`](#operation/createRestoreFileJob). With the request, include a request body. The following table describes the members of the request body.\n\n| Name | Description |\n| ---- | ----------- |\n| `path` | Full path of the file or folder. |\n| `domainName` | Authentication domain for the credentials being used to authenticate and authorize the action. |\n| `username` | Username of account to authenticate and authorize the action. |\n| `password` | Password for the account to authenticate and authorize the action. |\n| `restorePath` | Full path location for the restore of the file or folder. The action can create a directory at the end of the specified path, but cannot create directories that are specified within the path. |\n| `shouldUseAgent` | Instruct the Rubrik cluster to restore the file using Rubrik Backup Service running on virtual machine. Use `true` to restore using RBS and `false` to restore using `VMware tools`. |\n| `shouldSaveCredentials` | Instruct the Rubrik cluster to save the credentials included in the request. Use `true` to save the credentials and `false` to use the credentials only for the current request. |\n| `shouldRestoreXAttrs` | Instruct the Rubrik cluster to restore the\nextended attributes of all files and folders included in the `path`.\nWhen restoring to a Linux host, extended attributes are restored.\nWhen restoring to a Windows host, alternate data streams (ADS) are\nrestored. Use `true` to restore this metadata and `false` otherwise. |\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -d \\\n'{\n   \"path\": \"$full_source_path\",\n   \"domainName\": \"$auth_domain\",\n   \"username\": \"$username\",\n   \"password\": \"$password\",\n   \"restorePath\": \"$full_restore_path\",\n   \"shouldUseAgent\" : true,\n   \"shouldSaveCredentials\": true,\n   \"shouldRestoreXAttrs\": true\n }' \\\n \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot/$snapshot_id/restore_file\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server initiates the asynchronous request task and responds with a task object.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$restore_task_id\",\n  \"status\": \"QUEUED\",\n  \"progress\": 0,\n  \"startTime\": \"$timestamp\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter/request/$request_id\",\n      \"rel\": \"self\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n## Snapshot mount operations\nSnapshot mount operations include the following possible actions:\n* Retrieving a snapshot from an archival location\n* Mounting a snapshot by using Instant Recovery\n* Mounting a snapshot by using Live Mount\n* Mounting a snapshot for a batch of virtual machines using Live Mount\n* Exporting a snapshot\n* Downloading a snapshot from an archival location and then exporting it\n* Changing the properties of a mounted virtual machine\n* Removing a virtual machine mount\n* Migrating a datastore for a virtual machine from Live Mount or Instant Recovery\n\n### Retrieving a snapshot from an archival location\n\nTo work with a snapshot that is stored only at an archival location, first download the snapshot to the Rubrik cluster by sending a POST request to [`/vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/download`](#operation/createDownloadSnapshotFromCloud).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/snapshot/$snapshot_id/download\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server initiates the asynchronous request task and responds with a task object.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$snap_download_task_id\",\n  \"status\": \"QUEUED\",\n  \"progress\": 0,\n  \"startTime\": \"$timestamp\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vcenter/request/$request_id\",\n      \"rel\": \"self\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Mounting a snapshot by using Instant Recovery\n\nReplace a source virtual machine from a snapshot by using the Instant Recovery feature. To use Instant Recovery, send a POST request to [`/vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/instant_recover`](#operation/createInstantRecovery). This request requires a snapshot `id` and can optionally include the parameters that are described in the following table.\n\n| Name | Description |\n| ---- | ----------- |\n| `hostId` | The `id` of an ESXi hypervisor.

CloudOut.\n\nResource tags are associated with a cloud archival location, such as AWS or Azure. Rubrik CDM allows a maximum of 10 resource tags for each archival location. Check with the cloud provider for additional restrictions on resource tags.\n\nIf a compute resource supports tagging during creation by the cloud provider, user-defined resource tags are attached at resource creation time. Otherwise, user-defined resource tags are attached to the compute resource after creation.\n\n* Compute Instances: Bolt, Converter, Transient instances, Converted Instances\n* Disks/Snapshots: EBS Volumes/Snapshots, Managed Disks/Snapshot\n* Images: AMIs, Images\n\n## Query existing user-defined tags on a CDM cluster\n\nTo query existing user-defined tags on a CDM cluster, send a GET request to the\n[`/user_defined_tag`](#operation/queryUserDefinedTag) endpoint.\n\n**Example:** Query existing user-defined tags on a CDM cluster\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/user_defined_tag\"\n```\n\n```json\n{\n        \"resourceTags\": [{\n                \"id\": \"38400000-8cf0-11bd-b23e-10b96e4ef00d\",\n                \"key\": \"department\",\n                \"value\": \"engineering\",\n                \"lastUpdateTime\": \"2021-01-31T11:54:24 UTC\",\n                \"scopeRefId\": \"a0ef0663-7a7c-4027-9972-061780e52fee\"\n        }]\n}\n```\n\n## Create a new user-defined tag on a CDM cluster\n\nTo create a new user-defined tag on a CDM cluster, send a POST request to the\n[`/user_defined_tag`](#operation/createUserDefinedTag) endpoint.\n\n**Example:** Create a new user-defined tags on a CDM cluster\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n          \"key\": \"department\",\n          \"value\": \"engineering\",\n          \"scopeRefId\": \"a0ef0663-7a7c-4027-9972-061780e52fee\"\n    }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/user_defined_tag\"\n```\n\n```json\n{\n        \"id\": \"38400000-8cf0-11bd-b23e-10b96e4ef00d\",\n        \"key\": \"department\",\n        \"value\": \"engineering\",\n        \"lastUpdateTime\": \"2021-01-31T11:54:24 UTC\",\n        \"scopeRefId\": \"a0ef0663-7a7c-4027-9972-061780e52fee\"\n}\n```\n\n## Delete existing user-defined tags on a CDM cluster\n\nTo delete existing user-defined tags on a CDM cluster, send a DELETE request to the\n[`/user_defined_tag`](#operation/deleteUserDefinedTagBulk) endpoint.\n\n**Example:** Delete existing user-defined tags on a CDM cluster\n\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/user_defined_tag?ids=$id\"\n```\n\n```json\n{\n        \"ids\": [\"38400000-8cf0-11bd-b23e-10b96e4ef00d\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Get information about a user-defined tag on a CDM cluster\n\nTo fetch an existing user-defined tag on a CDM cluster, send a GET request to the\n[`/user_defined_tag/{id}`](#operation/getUserDefinedTag) endpoint.\n\n**Example:** To fetch an existing user-defined tag on a CDM cluster\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/user_defined_tag/$id\"\n```\n\n```json\n{\n        \"id\": \"38400000-8cf0-11bd-b23e-10b96e4ef00d\",\n        \"key\": \"department\",\n        \"value\": \"engineering\",\n        \"lastUpdateTime\": \"2021-01-31T11:54:24 UTC\",\n        \"scopeRefId\": \"a0ef0663-7a7c-4027-9972-061780e52fee\"\n}\n```\n\n## Update information about an existing user-defined tag on a CDM cluster\n\nTo update an existing user-defined tag on a CDM cluster, send a PATCH request to the\n[`/user_defined_tag/{id}`](#operation/updateUserDefinedTag) endpoint.\n\n**Example:** To update an existing user-defined tag on a CDM cluster\n\n```bash\ncurl -X PATCH \\\n -d '{\"value\": \"engineering\"}' \\\n \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/user_defined_tag/$id\"\n```\n```json\n{\n        \"id\": \"38400000-8cf0-11bd-b23e-10b96e4ef00d\",\n        \"key\": \"department\",\n        \"value\": \"engineering\",\n        \"lastUpdateTime\": \"2021-01-31T11:54:24 UTC\",\n        \"scopeRefId\": \"a0ef0663-7a7c-4027-9972-061780e52fee\"\n}\n```\n\n## Delete a existing user-defined tag on a CDM cluster\n\nTo delete an existing user-defined tag on a CDM cluster, send a DELETE request to the\n[`/user_defined_tag/{id}`](#operation/deleteUserDefinedTag) endpoint.\n\n**Example:** To delete an existing user-defined tag on a CDM cluster\n\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/user_defined_tag/$id\"\n```\n\n\n\n# Hosts\n\nRubrik clusters can protect file system data and application data through direct interaction with a host operating system. This method of protection does not require a virtual environment API. Instead, the Rubrik cluster works with the Rubrik Backup Service software that is running on supported Linux hosts and Windows hosts.\n\nIn some situations, the Rubrik cluster can directly interact with hosts without the Rubrik Backup Service, for example when providing protection of data on a network share.\n\n## Rubrik Backup Service\n\nThe Rubrik Backup Service software must be installed on a host to enable file system level protection and direct protection of supported applications. The Rubrik Backup Service software is signed by a specific Rubrik cluster and can only be used with that Rubrik cluster.\n\nThe following URLs provide access to the Rubrik Backup Service software on a Rubrik cluster:\n* Linux: https://$cluster_address/connector/rubrik-agent.x86_64.rpm\n* Windows: https://$cluster_address/connector/RubrikBackupService.zip\n\n**IMPORTANT:** The Rubrik User Guide describes how to install the Rubrik Backup Service software, and lists the permissions and settings that are required to allow the Rubrik Backup Service to provide support for specific operating systems, applications, and clusters.\n\n## Registering a host\nAfter installing the Rubrik Backup Service on a host, register the host with the Rubrik cluster. Registering initiates secure communication between the Rubrik cluster and the Rubrik Backup Service on the host. After a host is registered, the Rubrik Backup Service on the host sends detailed information about the host to the Rubrik cluster.\n\nThe Rubrik Backup Service scans a registered host for protectable objects, such as: applications, databases, and Windows clusters. The Rubrik Backup Service sends the results of the scan to the Rubrik cluster.\n\nTo register a host, send a POST request to [`/host`](#operation/registerHost) and include `hostname: $hostname`. The `$hostname` value must be the IPv4 address of the host or the resolvable hostname of the host.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    \"hostname\": \"$hostname\" }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/host\"\n```\n\nTo register the host and discover protection points of the host in the background, send a POST request to [`/host/background`](#operation/registerHostAsync) and include `hostname: $hostname`. The`$hostname` value must be the IPv4 address of the host or the resolvable hostname of the host.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    \"hostname\": \"$hostname\" }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/host/background\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the details for the host, including the connection status.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$host_id\",\n  \"name\": \"$hostname\",\n  \"hostname\": \"$hostname\", (deprecated)\n  \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\",\n  \"agentId\": \"$agent_id\",\n  \"operatingSystem\": \"$os_version\",\n  \"operatingSystemType\": \"$os_type\",\n  \"status\": \"Connected\",\n  \"compressionEnabled\": false\n}\n```\n\nTo register bulk hosts in the background, send a POST request to [`/host/bulk_background`](#operation/bulkRegisterHostAsync) and include `hostname: $hostname`. The`$hostname` value must be the IPv4 address of the host or the resolvable hostname of the host.\n\n```\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    [{\"hostname\": \"$hostname1\"}, {\"hostname\": \"$hostname2\"}] }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/host/bulk_background\"\n```\n\nThe `status` field in the response is returned as `Refreshing` until the host has finished discovering all the mssql instances, oracle DBs, etc. After this step, status is returned as `Connected` and all discovery is done for the host\n\nFor background hosts, the connection status is returned as `Refreshing` until the host is fully registered. After this step, that status is returned as `Connected` and all discovery is done for the host\n\n## Retrieving host information\n\nTo retrieve a current list of the hosts that are registered with a Rubrik cluster, send a GET request to [`/host`](#operation/queryHost).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/host\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with a ListResponse object that contains the first page of the current list.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": false,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"$host_id0\",\n      \"name\": \"$hostname0\",\n      \"hostname\": \"$hostname0\", (deprecated)\n      \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\",\n      \"operatingSystem\": \"$os_version0\",\n      \"operatingSystemType\": \"$os_type0\",\n      \"status\": \"Connected\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"$host_id1\",\n      \"name\": \"$hostname1\",\n      \"hostname\": \"$hostname1\", (deprecated)\n      \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\",\n      \"operatingSystem\": \"$os_version1\",\n      \"operatingSystemType\": \"$os_type1\",\n      \"status\": \"Connected\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total\": 2\n}\n```\nDepending on the number of registered hosts, the complete list of registered hosts may not be included on the first page. [Working with lists](#section/Overview/Working-with-lists) describes how to work with a ListResponse object to obtain additional pages of the list.\n\n\nTo retrieve the details for a specified host, send a GET request to [`/host/{id}`](#operation/getHost).\n\nAdding a host will cause Rubrik to communicate with the remote Rubrik agent and get detailed information about the host.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/host/$host_id0\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the details of the specified host.\n\n```bash\n  {\n    \"id\": \"$host_id0\",\n    \"name\": \"$hostname0\",\n    \"hostname\": \"$hostname0\", (deprecated)\n    \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\",\n    \"agentId\": \"$agent_id\",\n    \"operatingSystem\": \"$os_version0\",\n    \"operatingSystemType\": \"$os_type0\",\n    \"status\": \"Connected\",\n    \"compressionEnabled\": false\n  }\n```\n\n## Adding a host without the Rubrik Backup Service\n\nA host without the Rubrik Backup Service can be added by setting the `hasAgent` flag to `false`. This can be used to register a host that will be accessed through network shares.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{ \\\n    \"hostname\": \"$hostname\",\n    \"hasAgent\": \"false\" }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/host\"\n```\n\n## Modifying a registered host\n\nTo change the FQDN or IPv4 address that the Rubrik cluster uses to connect with a registered host, send a PATCH request to [`/host`](#operation/updateHost). Use the value of `hostname` to specify the new FQDN or IPv4 address of the host. Optionally, also use this PATCH request to specify whether to compress the data that is transmitted to and from the host. Set the value of `compressionEnabled` to `true` to enable compression or set the value to `false` to turn compression off.\n\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    \"hostname\": \"$hostname\",\n    \"compressionEnabled\": true }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/host/$host_id\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with a confirmation of the new details of the registered host.\n\n```bash\n {\n  \"id\": \"$host_id\",\n  \"name\": \"$hostname\",\n  \"hostname\": \"$hostname\", (deprecated)\n  \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\",\n  \"agentId\": \"$agent_id\",\n  \"operatingSystem\": \"$os_version\",\n  \"operatingSystemType\": \"$os_type\",\n  \"status\": \"Connected\",\n  \"compressionEnabled\": true\n }\n```\n## Removing a host\n\nRemove a host from the Rubrik cluster when the host no longer requires protection. The Rubrik cluster moves all of the unexpired backups for the host filesets of the host to Unmanaged Objects.\n\nTo remove a host send a DELETE request to [`/host/{id}`](#operation/deleteHost).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/host/$host_id\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with HTTP response code 204. This indicates the request succeeded and the response body is empty.\n\n## Refreshing a Host\n\nRefresh a host when changes made on the host do not appear in the\nRubrik web UI. The refresh requests updated information from the\nRubrik Backup Service that is running on the host.\n\nTo refresh a host send a POST request to\n[`/host/{id}/refresh`](#operation/refreshHost)\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/host/$host_id/refresh\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with HTTP response code 200 and\nincludes the updated properties of the host object in the response body.\n\n## Updating a Host Certificate\n\nWhen a host has a new certificate that is not registered with Rubrik\nthe Rubrik cluster will not communicate with that host until the\ncertificate is updated. In order to do that send a PUT request to\n[`/host/certificate/{id}`](#operation/updateCertificateHost)\n\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/host/certificate/$host_id\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the details of the specified host.\n\n## Migrate cluster associated with Rubrik Backup Service\n\nHosts can register with multiple clusters but can only communicate or back up to\na single cluster. Such a cluster is the primary cluster for that host. See the\nMulticluster Rubrik Backup Service section of the Rubrik CDM User Guide for\ndetails. To change the primary cluster to the current cluster, for Rubrik Backup\nService on a host, send a POST request to\n[`/host/make_primary`](#operation/hostMakePrimary).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    \"ids\": [\n      \"$host_id1\",\n      ...\n    ] }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/host/make_primary\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server initiates the asynchronous request task and responds\nwith a task object.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$request_id\",\n  \"status\": \"RUNNING\",\n  \"error\": \"None\",\n  \"progress\": \"$request_progress\"\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      href: \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/vmware/vm/request/$request_id\",\n      rel: \"self\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo migrate the Rubrik Backup Service on a virtual machine, see the\n[corresponding virtual machine API](#section/Virtual-machines/Migrate-cluster-associated-with-Rubrik-Backup-Service).\n\nAlternatively, in a disaster recovery scenario, when migrating the primary\ncluster for all hosts *and* virtual machines from an old cluster to this one,\nsend a POST request to [`/host/make_primary`](#operation/hostMakePrimary) with\noldPrimaryClusterUuid specified. Note that the hosts and virtual machines must\nalready have been registered on this cluster.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    \"oldPrimaryClusterUuid\": \"12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef\" }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/host/make_primary\"\n```\n\n## Windows Server Failover Clustering nodes\n\nTo begin working with Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) clusters, register each WSFC node with the Rubrik cluster as described in [`Registering a host`](#section/Hosts/Registering-a-host). The scan performed by the Rubrik Backup Service on each WSFC node detects the WSFC cluster and provides information about the WSFC cluster to the Rubrik cluster.\n\nTo view WSFC cluster information, send a GET request to [`/windows_cluster`](#operation/queryWindowsCluster).\n\n**Note:** The variable `$cluster_address` refers to the FQDN or IPv4 address of the Rubrik cluster.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/windows_cluster\"\n```\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with a ListResponse object that contains the first page of the list of WSFC clusters.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": false,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"$wsfc_id\",\n      \"name\": \"$wsfc_name\",\n      \"fqdn\": \"$wsfc_fqdn\",\n      \"hostIds\": [\n        \"$wsfc_node_id0\",\n        \"$wsfc_node_id1\"\n      ],\n      \"primaryClusterId\": \"$cluster_id\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total\": 1\n}\n```\n\nTo retrieve detailed information about a WSFC cluster, send a GET request to: [`/windows_cluster/{id}`](#operation/getWindowsCluster), where `$cluster_id` is the `id` of the WSFC cluster.\n\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/windows_cluster/$cluster_id\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the details for the specified WSFC cluster.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"name\":

on a Linux, Unix, or\nWindows host, or on NAS shares. The Rubrik cluster uses the filesets\nthat are specified for a host or a NAS share to determine the data to\nprotect on that host or share.\n\nThe Rubrik cluster interprets a fileset based on the values provided in\nthe Include, Exclude, and Do Not Exclude arrays of the fileset template\nthat the fileset is based on. The Rubrik cluster uses the values of the\narrays to determine the files and folders in a fileset. The Do Not\nExclude array specifies objects that should not be excluded from the\nfileset by the values in the Exclude array.\n\n## Fileset workflow\nTo protect data through filesets perform the following tasks:\n1. Obtain and install the Rubrik Backup Service software on the host.\nThe *Rubrik CDM User Guide* describes this task.\n2. Add the host to the Rubrik cluster.\nThe [Hosts](#section/Hosts) section describes this task.\n3. Create a fileset template that defines a set of file system data to\nprotect.\nThe [Fileset templates](#fileset-templates) section describes this task.\n4. Use a fileset template to assign a fileset to a host.\n5. Assign the host fileset to an SLA Domain.\n\n## Fileset templates\nA fileset template encompasses a set of file system metadata that is\nneeded to define filesets. The metadata includes the file system\npaths on the host that need protection or paths that do not need\nprotection.\nThe metadata varies with the type of the host or the NAS share to\nwhich the template applies.\n\n### Retrieving fileset templates\nTo retrieve the current list of fileset templates, send a GET request to the\n[`/fileset_template`](#operation/queryFilesetTemplate) endpoint.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n\"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/fileset_template\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with a ListResponse object containing the\nfirst page of the current list of fileset templates.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"hasMore\": false,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"allowBackupNetworkMounts\": false,\n      \"allowBackupHiddenFoldersInNetworkMounts\": false,\n

\"hostCount\": 0,\n      \"shareCount\": 0\n    }\n   ],\n   \"total\": 1\n }\n```\n\nTo retrieve the details of a specific fileset template, send a GET request\nto the [`fileset_template/{id}`](#operation/getFilesetTemplate) endpoint.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/fileset_template/$fileset_template_id0\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the details of the fileset template\nidentified by the value of the `{id}` path parameter.\n\n### Creating a fileset template\nCreate a fileset template to simplify creating identical filesets for\nmultiple hosts.\n\nOperations for a fileset object are described in the\n[Fileset](#fileset) section.\n\nTo create a fileset-template, send a POST request to\n[`/fileset_template`](#operation/createFilesetTemplate) with the\nrequired details: `name`, `includes`, and `operatingSystemType`\nor `shareType`.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    \"name\": \"Users\",\n    \"includes\": [\"C:\\\\Users\"],\n    \"operatingSystemType\": \"$os_type1\"\n    }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/fileset_template\"\n```\nTo create a fileset template for a specific type of NAS share, replace\n`operatingSystemType` with `shareType` in the above payload.\nFor example, `\"shareType\":\"NFS\"`.\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the new fileset template object.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"allowBackupNetworkMounts\": true,\n  \"allowBackupHiddenFoldersInNetworkMounts\": true,\n  \"useWindowsVss\": true,\n  \"name\": \"Users\",\n  \"includes\": [\n    \"C:\\\\users\"\n  ],\n  \"excludes\": [],\n  \"exceptions\": [],\n  \"operatingSystemType\": \"$os_type1\",\n  \"isArrayEnabled\": false,\n  \"id\": \"$fileset_template_id1\",\n

The Rubrik cluster uses the directorys that are assigned to a HDFS cluster to determine the data to protect on that cluster.\n\nThe Rubrik cluster interprets a directory based on the values provided in the\nInclude, Exclude, and Do Not Exclude arrays. The Rubrik cluster applies a\nset of rules to the values provided in these arrays and permits several\ntypes of values to be added to the arrays. The Do Not Exclude array specifies objects that should not be excluded from the directory by the values in the Exclude array.\n\n## Directory workflow\nThe basic workflow to follow when using directorys to protect data in host file systems is:\n1. Obtain and install the Rubrik Backup Service software on the HDFS cluster.\nThe Rubrik user guide describes this task.\n2. Add the HDFS cluster to the Rubrik cluster.\nThe [Hosts](#section/Hosts) section describes this task.\n3. Create a directory template that defines a set of file system data to protect.\n4. Use a directory template to assign a directory to a host.\n5. Assign the host directory to an SLA Domain.\n\n## Directory templates\n\nFirst, create a directory template.\nA directory template can be used to create directory instances for various HDFS clusters.\nPerforming a POST on [`/hdfs_template`](#operation/createHdfsTemplate)  with the necessary details will create a directory template.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    \"name\":

pattern\n\nAn exclusion pattern is a regular expression pattern that enables Rubrik clusters to exclude files and folders, with names that match the regular expression pattern, from search results. Once created, the Rubrik cluster applies the exclusion pattern to the global search results and the snapshot level search results. The exclusion patterns also exclude matching files and folders from the recovery process.\n\nA Rubrik cluster can apply the exclusion pattern on a particular [Fileset](#section/Filesets) or on all the filesets associated with a particular [Host](#section/Hosts).\n\nThe exclusion patterns are either mutable or immutable. By default, the exclusion patterns are mutable or editable upon creation.\n\nThe Rubrik REST API exposes endpoints to:\n\n* create a single exclusion pattern\n* create multiple exclusion patterns, in bulk\n* get details of all the existing exclusion patterns\n* view details of a specific exclusion pattern\n* update an existing exclusion pattern\n* delete a single exclusion pattern\n* delete multiple exclusion patterns, in bulk\n\n## Adding an exclusion pattern\nTo create a new exclusion pattern, send a POST request to [/exclusion_pattern](#operation/createExclusionPattern).\nThe request payload must include the following attributes required to create an exclusion pattern:\n* `sourceId` - The ID for a fileset or a host to which the pattern will apply.\n* `pattern` - The regular expression pattern.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    \"sourceId\": \"$sourceId\",\n    \"pattern\": \"$pattern\" }' \\\n  \"https://$cluster_address/api/v1/exclusion_pattern\"\n```\n\nThe Rubrik REST API server responds with the details of the new exclusion pattern.\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"id\": \"$id\",\n  \"sourceId\": \"$sourceId\",\n  \"pattern\": \"$pattern\",\n  \"isMutable\": true,\n  \"patternStatus\": \"Queued\",\n  \"isActive\": true,\n  \"primaryClusterId\": \"$primaryClusterId\"\n}\n```\n\n## Bulk adding exclusion patterns\nTo create exclusion patterns in bulk, send a POST request to [/exclusion_pattern/bulk](#operation/bulkCreateExclusionPattern).\nThe request payload must be an array.

      "description": "Download OpenAPI specification: [openapi.yml](openapi.yml)\n\n**Other documentation sources**:\n\n* [Main documentation](https://docs.rudder.io)\n* [Internal relay API](https://docs.rudder.io/api/relay/)\n\n# Introduction\n\nRudder exposes a REST API, enabling the user to interact with Rudder without using the webapp, for example, in scripts or cron jobs.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe Rudder REST API uses simple API keys for authentication.\nAll requests must be authenticated (except from a generic status API).\nThe tokens are 32-character strings, passed in a `X-API-Token` header, like in: \n\n```bash\ncurl --header \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/latest/rules\n```\n\nThe tokens are the API equivalent of a password, and must\nbe secured just like a password would be.\n\n### API accounts\n\nThe accounts are managed in the Web interface. There are three types of accounts:\n\n* **Global API accounts**: they are not linked to a Rudder user, and are managed by Rudder administrators in the _Administration -> API accounts_ page. You should define an expiration date whenever possible.\n\n![General API tokens settings](assets/api-tokens.png \"General API tokens settings\")\n\n* **User tokens**: they are linked to a Rudder user, and give the same rights the user has.\nThere can be only one token by user. This feature is provided by the `api-authorizatons` plugin.\n\n![User API token](assets/api-user.png \"User API token\")\n\n* **System token**: it is a special token, not visible in the interface. Its value is postfixed with `-system`\nand is regenerated at each application restart. It is designed to allow running local calls to the API\nwithout having to configure an account. The token is written\ninto `/var/rudder/run/api-token` and only readable by the `root` user. When using the token with `curl`, you should use the\nalternative form to prevent leaking the token in the process list:\n\n```\ncurl --header @/var/rudder/run/api-token-header\n```\n\nWhen an action produces a change of configuration on the server, the API account that made it will\nbe recorded in the event log, like for a Web interaction.\n\n### Authorization\n\nWhen using Rudder without the `api-authorizatons` plugin, only global accounts are available, with\ntwo possible privilege levels, read-only or write.\nWith the `api-authorizatons` plugin, you also get access to:\n\n* User tokens, which have the same permissions as the user, using the Rudder roles and permissions feature.\n* Custom ACLs on global API accounts. They provide fine-grained permissions on every endpoint:\n\n![Custom API ACL](assets/custom-acl.png \"Custom API ACL\")\n\nAs a general principle,\nyou should create dedicated tokens with the least privilege level for each different interaction you have with the\nAPI.\nThis limits the risks of exploitation if a token is stolen, and allows tracking the activity\nof each token separately. Token renewal is also easier when they are only used for a limited purpose.\n\n## Versioning\n\nEach time the API is extended with new features (new functions, new parameters, new responses, ...), it will be assigned a new version number. This will allow you\nto keep your existing scripts (based on previous behavior). Versions will always be integers (no 2.1 or 3.3, just 2, 3, 4, ...) or `latest`.\n\nYou can change the version of the API used by setting it either within the url or in a header:\n\n* the URL: each URL is prefixed by its version id, like `/api/version/function`.\n\n```bash\n# Version 10\ncurl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/10/rules\n# Latest\ncurl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/latest/rules\n# Wrong (not an integer) => 404 not found\ncurl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/3.14/rules\n```\n\n* the HTTP headers. You can add the **X-API-Version** header to your request. The value needs to be an integer or `latest`.\n\n```bash\n# Version 10\ncurl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H \"X-API-Version: 10\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules\n# Wrong => Error response indicating which versions are available\ncurl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H \"X-API-Version: 3.14\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules\n```\n\nIn the future, we may declare some versions as deprecated, in order to remove them in a later version of Rudder, but we will never remove any versions without warning, or without a safe\nperiod of time to allow migration from previous versions.\n\n\n<h4>Existing versions</h4>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"width: 20%\">Version</th>\n      <th style=\"width: 20%\">Rudder versions it appeared in</th>\n      <th style=\"width: 70%\">Description</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">1</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">Never released (for internal use only)</td>\n      <td>Experimental version</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">2 to 10 (deprecated)</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">4.3 and before</td>\n      <td>These versions provided the core set of API features for rules, directives, nodes global parameters, change requests and compliance, rudder settings, and system API</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">11</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">5.0</td>\n      <td>New system API (replacing old localhost v1 api): status, maintenance operations and server behavior</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">12</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">6.0 and 6.1</td>\n      <td>Node key management</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">13</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">6.2</td>\n      <td><ul>\n        <li>Node status endpoint</li>\n        <li>System health check</li>\n        <li>System maintenance job to purge software [that endpoint was back-ported in 6.1]</li>\n      </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">14</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">7.0</td>\n      <td><ul>\n        <li>Secret management</li>\n        <li>Directive tree</li>\n        <li>Improve techniques management</li>\n        <li>Demote a relay</li>\n      </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">15</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">7.1</td>\n      <td><ul>\n        <li>Package updates in nodes</li>\n      </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">16</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">7.2</td>\n      <td><ul>\n        <li>Create node API included from plugin</li>\n        <li>Configuration archive import/export</li>\n      </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">17</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">7.3</td>\n      <td><ul>\n        <li>Compliance by directive</li>\n        <li>Path campaigns API included</li>\n      </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">18</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">8.0</td>\n      <td><ul>\n        <li>Allowed network </li>\n        <li>Improve the structure of `/settings/allowed_networks` output</li>\n      </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">19</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">8.1</td>\n      <td><ul>\n        <li>Multi-tenants</li>\n        <li>Scores list</li>\n      </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">20</td>\n      <td class=\"code\">8.2</td>\n      <td><ul>\n        <li>More standard format for node details fields</li>\n      </ul></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n## Response format\n\nAll responses from the API are in the JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"The name of the called function\",\n  \"id\": \"The ID of the element you want, if relevant\",\n  \"result\": \"The result of your action: success or error\",\n  \"data\": \"Only present if this is a success and depends on the function, it's usually a JSON object\",\n  \"errorDetails\": \"Only present if this is an error, it contains the error message\"\n}\n```\n\n\n* __Success__ responses are sent with the 200 HTTP (Success) code\n\n* __Error__ responses are sent with a HTTP error code (mostly 5xx...)\n\n\n## HTTP method\n\nRudder's REST API is based on the usage of [HTTP methods](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html). We use them to indicate what action will be done by the request. Currently, we use four of them:\n\n\n* **GET**: search or retrieve information (get rule details, get a group, ...)\n\n* **PUT**: add new objects (create a directive, clone a Rule, ...)\n\n* **DELETE**: remove objects (delete a node, delete a parameter, ...)\n\n* **POST**: update existing objects (update a directive, reload a group, ...)\n\n\n## Parameters\n\n### General parameters\n\nSome parameters are available for almost all API functions. They will be described in this section.\nThey must be part of the query and can't be submitted in a JSON form.\n\n#### Available for all requests\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"width: 30%\">Field</th>\n      <th style=\"width: 10%\">Type</th>\n      <th style=\"width: 70%\">Description</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"code\">prettify</td>\n      <td><b>boolean</b><br><i>optional</i></td>\n      <td>\n        Determine if the answer should be prettified (human friendly) or not.

The function will not work if this resource is missing.\n\n```bash\n# Get the Rule of ID \"id\"\ncurl -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/latest/rules/id\n```\n\nCAUTION: To avoid surprising behavior, do not put a '/' at the end of a URL: it would be interpreted as '/[empty string parameter]' and redirected to '/index', likely not what you wanted to do.\n\n\n#### Sending data for POST/PUT requests\n\n##### Directly in JSON format\n\nJSON format is the preferred way to interact with Rudder API for creating or updating resources.\nYou'll also have to set the *Content-Type* header to **application/json** (without it the JSON content would be ignored).\nIn a `curl` `POST` request, that header can be provided with the `-H` parameter:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" ...\n```\n\nThe supplied file must contain a valid JSON: strings need quotes, booleans and integers don't, etc.\n\nThe (human-readable) format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"key1\": \"value1\",\n  \"key2\": false,\n  \"key3\": 42\n}\n```\n\nHere is an example with inlined data:\n\n```bash\n# Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive\ncurl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H  \"Content-Type: application/json\"\nhttps://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id}\n  -d '{ \"displayName\": \"new name\", \"enabled\": false, \"directives\": \"directiveId\"}'\n```\n\nYou can also pass a supply the JSON in a file:\n\n```bash\n# Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive\ncurl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id} -d @jsonParam\n```\n\nNote that the general parameters view in the previous chapter cannot be passed in a JSON, and you will need to pass them a URL parameters if you want them to be taken into account (you can't mix JSON and request parameters):\n\n```bash\n# Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive with reason message \"Reason used\"\ncurl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id}?reason=Reason used\" -d @jsonParam -d \"reason=Reason ignored\"\n```\n\n##### Request parameters\n\nIn some cases, when you have little, simple data to update, JSON can feel bloated. In such cases, you can use\nrequest parameters. You will need to pass one parameter for each data you want to change.\n\nParameters follow the following schema:\n\n```\nkey=value\n```\n\nYou can pass parameters by two means:\n\n* As query parameters: At the end of your url, put a **?** then your first parameter and then a **&** before next parameters. In that case, parameters need to be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding[URL encoded]\n\n```bash\n# Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive\ncurl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\"  https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id}?\"displayName=my new name\"&\"enabled=false\"&\"directives=aDirectiveId\"\n```\n\n* As request data: You can pass those parameters in the request data, they won't figure in the URL, making it lighter to read, You can pass a file that contains data.\n\n```bash\n# Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive (in file directive-info.json)\ncurl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\"\nhttps://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id} -d \"displayName=my new name\" -d \"enabled=false\" -d @directive-info.json\n```\n",

      "description": "# Introduction\n\nWelcome to the documentation for the Sakari Messaging REST API. \n\nSakari provides an advanced platform to drive large scale customized SMS communication\n\nREST is a web-service protocol that lends itself to rapid development by using everyday HTTP and JSON technology.\n\nTo find out more about our product offering, please visit [https://sakari.io](https://sakari.io).\n\n# Quickstart\n\nFor your convenience we have created a quickstart guide to get you up and running in 5 minutes. \n\n[https://sakari.io/blog/sakari-api-quickstart](https://sakari.io/blog/sakari-api-quickstart)\n\n# PostMan Collection\n\nWe've created a simple set of examples using [PostMan](https://www.getpostman.com/) Simply click below to import these. You will need to setup three environment variables in PostMan - AccountId, ClientId and ClientSecret. Check out our PostMan blog post for more information\n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/d616e273edc916a7a6eb)\n\n# Finding your client id, client secret and account id\n\nTo authenticate against the API's you will need three key pieces of data\n - client id\n - client secret\n - account id\n\nTo retrieve these, simply login into [https://hub.sakari.io](https://hub.sakari.io) and click on the \"cog\" in the top right corner. In the popup dialog at the bottom you should see your API credentials and account id. If these are not visible you will need to click on \"Request Credentials\"\n\n# Versioning\n\nWith any breaking changes we will introduce a new version of the API. The latest version is v1.\n\nThe API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional properties in responses to ensure they do not break.\n\n# Testing\n\nThere are numerous tools available for testing the API's. We will include examples using curl and the client SDKs that we have created. If you would like to see an SDK in a language not currently available, please let us know.\n\n# Throttling / Limits\n\nOur API's have been specifically designed to support bulk messaging in a single API call. We therefore impose limits on the frequency of calling the APIs to prevent abuse or runaway processes. If you feel you need a higher limit, please contact us. If you hit the limit you will get a 429 error code returned from our servers\n\n# Errors\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"success\": false,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"CONT-001\",\n    \"message\": \"Invalid mobile number\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n# Pagination\n\nFor performance, most GET calls return a subset of data. This data is paginated for easy access. Most APIs which return collections of data will return a pagination object as such:\n\n```\n{\n  \"pagination\": {\n    \"offset\": 0,\n    \"limit\": 10\n    \"totalCount\": 21\n  }  \n}\n```\n\nWhen making calls to the API, you can adjust the slice of data returned using query parameters such as:\n\n`` https://api.sakari.io/v1/accounts/123/contacts?offset=20&limit=25 ``\n\nThis will return 25 contacts with an offset of 20.\n",

If no contacts are added to or removed from a segment since the last refresh, the sample and UI count displayed will be refreshed at increasing time intervals with a maximum sample and count refresh delay of 24 hours.\n\nYou can also manage your Segments with the [Marketing Campaigns application user interface](https://mc.sendgrid.com/contacts).

      "description": "# カラーミーショップアプリストア API\n\n[アプリストア](https://app.shop-pro.jp/)にて公開するアプリに対して、一般公開している[カラーミーショップAPI](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/docs/colorme-api)に加えて、カラーミーショップアプリストアAPI（以下、アプリストアAPIといいます）を利用することが出来ます。アプリストアAPIでは以下のことが行えます。\n- 課金データ(アプリ内課金、従量課金)の作成\n- インラインスクリプトタグの取得・作成・更新・削除\n- スクリプトタグの取得・作成・更新・削除\n\n## 利用手順\n\nアプリストアAPIを利用するには、OAuth認証が必要です。OAuth認証の基本的な流れについては[カラーミーショップAPIドキュメント](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/docs/colorme-api)を参照してください。\nアプリストアAPIの利用のために、以下のscopeが追加で指定可能になります。[カラーミーショップAPIドキュメント](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/docs/colorme-api)に掲載されているscopeと合わせてご利用ください。\n\n|スコープ|機能|\n|---|---|\n|`write_application_charge`|課金データの作成|\n|`read_shop_script_tags`|ショップページのスクリプトタグを参照|\n|`write_shop_script_tags`|ショップページへスクリプトタグを追加・更新|\n|`read_inline_script_tags`|インラインスクリプトタグを参照|\n|`write_inline_script_tags`|インラインスクリプトタグを追加・更新|\n|`read_script_tags`|スクリプトタグを参照(deprecated)|\n|`write_script_tags`|スクリプトタグを追加・更新(deprecated)|\n\n(例) カラーミーショップアカウントの認証ページを表示\n```\nhttps://api.shop-pro.jp/oauth/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=read_products%20write_products%20write_application_charge\n```\n\n## 課金設定\n料金プラン（月額課金・従量課金・買い切り）による課金や、アプリ内課金をご利用いただくにはアプリごとに課金設定の登録が必要です。\nこの設定は [カラーミーショップ デベロッパー](https://developer.shop-pro.jp) から行うことができます。\n\n登録できる課金形式やその使い方の詳細については[アプリストア 開発ガイドのアプリ課金のページ](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/getting-started/appstore-billing/)をご覧ください\n\n## アプリのインストール\nショップオーナーがアプリをインストールしたとき、以下の処理をカラーミーショップが行います。\n- 選択された料金プランに基づき課金開始\n- インストールフックの呼び出し\n\n### インストールフック\nアプリのインストール時に、インストールに関する情報を `POST` メソッド、 `application/json` 形式で通知します。\n通知先のURLは[カラーミーショップ デベロッパー](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/)にログインし、各アプリストア アプリのアプリ設定から登録を行ってください。\n\n以下のパラメータが送信されます。課金請求に必要なパラメータを含みますので、必ず受け取れるようにしてください。\n\n|パラメータ|機能|形式|\n|---|---|---|\n|`account_id`|インストールしたショップオーナーのアカウントID|PA+8桁の整数|\n|`application_charge_source_id`|プラン課金ID|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)|\n|`recurring_application_charge_id`|（買い切り以外の課金の場合）課金契約ID|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)|\n|`application_charge_id`|（買い切りの場合）課金契約ID|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)|\n|`trial_term`|（無料お試し期間がある場合）無料お試し期間|JSONオブジェクト|\n|`mail`|ショップオーナーへの連絡メールアドレス|文字列|\n\n`application_charge_source_id` はデベロッパーサイトで設定したプラン課金のIDです。インストールされた料金プランの判別にご利用いただけます。\n\n`recurring_application_charge_id` と `application_charge_id` はインストールごとに発行されるユニークなIDです。ショップオーナーが一度アンインストールした後に、再度同じショップオーナーがアプリのインストールを行った際には新たに別のIDが発行されます。\n\n`recurring_application_charge_id` は「買い切り」以外の課金である「無料」「月額」「月額＋従量」「月額＋初期費用」「従量のみ」のプラン課金のインストールの際に発行されます。\n\n従量による課金を伴うプラン課金の場合は、従量分の料金を請求する際に 課金契約ID(`recurring_application_charge_id`) が必要になるので、必ず記録するようにしてください。\n\n`mail` パラメータの値はショップオーナーへの連絡手段としてご利用いただけます。インストール後に認可フローが中断され、アクセストークンが得られない際のショップオーナーへの連絡手段としてご活用いただけます。このパラメータはカラーミーショップの非公開情報として登録されている値です。左記以外の用途でこの値をアプリの機能で使用しないでください。\n\n例) 買い切りの場合\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"PA00000001\",\n  \"application_charge_source_id\": \"F3RN9A\",\n  \"application_charge_id\": \"A3FT4N\",\n  \"mail\": \"shop@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n例) 月額課金の場合\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"PA00000001\",\n  \"application_charge_source_id\": \"F3RN9A\",\n  \"recurring_application_charge_id\": \"A3FT4N\",\n  \"mail\": \"shop@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n無料お試し期間を設定した課金の場合、以下の情報を `trial_term` パラメータとして送信します。\n無料お試し期間中は従量課金APIを呼び出して課金請求することはできません。\n\n|パラメータ|機能|形式|\n|---|---|---|\n|`starts_at`|無料お試し開始日時|整数値(UNIXタイムスタンプ)|\n|`ends_at`|無料お試し終了日時|整数値(UNIXタイムスタンプ)|\n\n例) 無料お試し期間がある月額課金の場合\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"PA00000001\",\n  \"application_charge_source_id\": \"F3RN9A\",\n  \"recurring_application_charge_id\": \"A3FT4N\",\n  \"mail\": \"shop@example.com\",\n  \"trial_term\" {\n    \"starts_at\": 1565017200,\n    \"ends_at\": 1567609200\n  }\n}\n```\n\n受け取りに成功した場合は、以下のパラメータを `application/json` 形式でレスポンスボディに付与し、\nステータスコード `200` レスポンスをカラーミーショップへ返却してください。\nステータスコード `200` レスポンスをカラーミーショップが受け取れない場合、もしくは以下のパラメーターが返却されなかった場合、インストールを中止し、インストールによって発生した情報は破棄されます。\n\n|パラメータ|機能|形式|\n|---|---|---|\n|`redirect_url`|インストール成功後に遷移するURL|文字列（URL）|\n\n例)\n```\n{\n  \"redirect_url\": \"https://example.com\"\n}\n```\nインストール完了後、インストールフックのレスポンスパラメータの `redirect_url` へ画面遷移しますので、APIを利用する場合は `redirect_url` より先の画面でOAuth認証の実装をお願いします。\n\n## アプリのアンインストール\nショップオーナーがアプリをアンインストールしたとき、以下の処理をカラーミーショップが行います。\n- OAuth認証のアクセストークンの無効化\n- 登録したインラインスクリプトタグ・スクリプトタグの削除\n- 月額課金形式の場合、継続課金の無効化\n\n### アンインストールフック\nアンインストール直後に `POST` メソッドで、以下の情報を `application/json` 形式で通知します。\n通知先のURLは[カラーミーショップ デベロッパー](https://developer.shop-pro.jp/)にログインし、各アプリストア アプリのアプリ設定から登録を行ってください。\n\n※ [アンインストールAPI](#operation/deleteInstallation)のご利用によるアンインストール時はアンインストールフックは通知されません。\n\n受け取りに成功した場合はステータスコード `200` のレスポンスを返却してください。\n\n|パラメータ|機能|形式|\n|---|---|---|\n|`account_id`|アンインストールしたショップオーナーのアカウントID|PA+8桁の整数|\n|`application_charge_source_id`|プラン課金ID|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)|\n|`uninstalled_at`|アンインストール日時|整数値(UNIXタイムスタンプ)|\n|`reason`|アンインストール理由| `by_shop_owner` (ショップオーナーによる)<br /> `by_unpaid` (未払いによる) |\n|`recurring_application_charge_id`|（買い切り以外の課金の場合）課金契約ID|数字と大文字アルファベットで構成される文字列(6桁以上)|\n|`usage_charge`|（従量課金の場合）従量課金アンインストール情報|JSONオブジェクト|\n\nアンインストールフックの通知が伴うアンインストールは以下の操作のいずれかによって行われます。アンインストールの理由を `reason` パラメータで確認できます。\n\n|reasonパラメータの値|アンインストール理由|\n|---|---|\n|`by_shop_owner`|ショップオーナーによるアンインストール操作|\n|`by_unpaid`|ポイント不足による利用料徴収の失敗による自動アンインストール|\n\n課金契約ID `recurring_application_charge_id` はインストールフックで通知したIDと同じIDが通知されます。\n\n料金プランが従量課金の場合、アンインストール後に従量課金データの作成を可能にするために、以下の情報を `usage_charge` パラメータとして送信します。\nアンインストール後はOAuthのアクセストークンが無効化されているため、アクセストークンを利用して従量課金APIを呼び出すことができなくなります。\nアンインストール後はアクセストークンの代わりに `api_token` をリクエストヘッダーに含め、従量課金APIを呼び出してください。\n無料お試し期間中にアプリがアンインストールされた場合は、`api_token` は発行されません。\n詳しくは、[従量課金データの作成](https://app.shop-pro.jp/open_api#operation/createUsageCharge)を参照してください。\n`api_token` を利用した従量課金APIの呼び出しは、ポイント締め日 `closing_on` までとなっておりますので、ご注意ください。\n\n|パラメータ|機能|形式|\n|---|---|---|\n|`api_token`|アンインストール後に従量課金APIを利用いただくために必要な情報|文字列|\n|`closing_on`|ポイント締め日|整数値(UNIXタイムスタンプ)|\n\n通常、 `closing_on` は、アンインストール直前まで利用されていた契約の期間の月末となります。以下に例を示します。\n\n|アンインストール日|直前まで利用されていた契約の期間|closing_on の示す日時|\n|---|---|---|\n|2021/01/09|2021/12/10〜2021/01/09|2021/01/31|\n|2021/01/10|2021/01/10〜2021/02/09|2021/02/28|\n\n従量課金の場合のユーザーの契約期間については[こちら](https://help.shop-pro.jp/hc/ja/articles/1500003545562)をご参照ください\n\nアンインストールフックの例を以下に示します。\n\n例) 買い切りの場合\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"PA00000001\",\n  \"application_charge_source_id\": \"Q21GPC\",\n  \"uninstalled_at\": 1552022739,\n  \"reason\": \"by_shop_owner\"\n}\n```\n\n例) 月額課金の場合\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"PA00000001\",\n  \"application_charge_source_id\": \"EW3V21\",\n  \"recurring_application_charge_id\": \"F3RN9A\",\n  \"uninstalled_at\": 1552022740,\n  \"reason\": \"by_shop_owner\"\n}\n```\n\n例) 従量課金を含む月額課金の場合\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"PA00000001\",\n  \"application_charge_source_id\": \"WA37CA\",\n  \"recurring_application_charge_id\": \"F3WQ1S\",\n  \"uninstalled_at\": 1552022740,\n  \"reason\": \"by_shop_owner\",\n  \"usage_charge\": {\n    \"api_token\": \"token\",\n    \"closing_on\": 1552533465\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### アンインストールフックのリトライ\nステータスコード `200` のレスポンスをカラーミーショップが受け取れない場合は、ステータスコード `200` をカラーミーショップが受け取るまで、以下の条件で再度アンインストール情報を送信します。\nなお、カラーミーショップによるアンインストール処理は、アンインストールフックの送信結果の成否によらず、アンインストールが実行されたときに完了します。\n\n- 2時間30分ごとにアンインストールフックの仕様に基づき再送します\n- 最大で合計19回再送します\n- すべての再送の試行でステータスコード `200` をカラーミーショップが受け取れない場合は、公認デベロッパー申請時に登録されたメールアドレス宛にメールを送信します\n\n## インストール・アンインストールフックの署名検証\n`X-Appstore-Signature` リクエストヘッダーに含まれる署名を検証して、リクエストがカラーミーショップから送信されたことを確認することを推奨します。\n\n検証の手順は以下のとおりです。\n\n1. カラーミーショップが発行した `webhook_secret` を秘密鍵として、HMAC-SHA256アルゴリズムを使用してリクエストボディのダイジェスト値を取得します。\n2. ダイジェスト値をBase64エンコードした値とリクエストヘッダーに付与された署名( `X-Appstore-Signature` の値）が一致することを確認します。\n\n\nサンプルコード(ruby)\n```ruby\nWEBHOOK_SECRET = 'my_webhook_secret'\n\npayload_body = request.body.read\nsignature = Base64.strict_encode64(OpenSSL::HMAC.digest('sha256', WEBHOOK_SECRET, payload_body))\nActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(signature, request.env['HTTP_X_APPSTORE_SIGNATURE'])\n```\n\n### 発信元IPアドレスについて\n\n発信元IPアドレスは固定ではありません。そのためIPアドレスが固定されていることを前提としてアプリケーションを開発しないでください。\n\nインストールフックおよびアンインストールフックのリクエストの発信元を検証する場合は上記の署名検証を行なってください。\n",

      "name": "Shorten.REST API Documentation",
      "description": "## Introduction\n\n\nThe Shorten.rest API allows you to programmatically create short URLs (an &apos;alias&apos;) for longer URL (a &apos;destination&apos;).\n\nEach alias you create can be used to redirect the end user (person clicking on the link) to one or more destination URLs\n\nA default destination is always set and specific destinations can be set to redirect the end user to preferred destinations based on the user&apos;s geographical location (country) and device Operating System.\n\nIn order to use the Shorten.Rest URL Shortening API you can choose to bind your own branded domain, sub-domain or to use our default domain - Short.FYI \n\n ### Destination Matching \n\n When creating or editing a short URL (&apos;alias&apos;) you can choose to specify a destination for each country and OS ([Supported OSes list](#tag/OperatingSystems)) combination. \n\n When a user clicks on the short link, Shorten.rest will examine the end user's country (determined by User's IP) and OS (User agent) and match the most suitable destination for each user. \n\n (*) If no destination is set for a specific request combination Shorten.rest will use the default destination that exists within each short URL \n\n (**) BRANDED DOMAINS: If the requested alias does not exist in our database - Shorten.rest will redirect the user to the default fallback you set within your dashboard under the ‘Alias Not Found Page Url’ value for a custom domain. \n\n (***) Operating System (OS) destinations are stronger than a country destination! \n For example - if you have a custom landing page that is targeting people in the USA and a second landing page that is hyper focused for people who use iOS devices - a person clicking on your link in the USA that is on an iPhone will be redirected to the iOS landing page, while all other devices will be redirected to the USA landing page. \n\n | OS  | Country  | Destination |\n| :------------: |:---------------:| -----|\n| iOS      |  | YourDestination.com/ios |\n|       | US        |   YourDestination.com/usa | \n\n Shorten.rest will choose the YourDestination.com/ios url as the most suitable destination.\n\n ### Branded Domain Attributes \n\n When setting up your custom domain you can include optional metatags and snippets ([Supported snippets list](#tag/Snippets)). These parameters (such as retargeting, tracking and conversion pixels) are populated and fired on click - at the time of the redirect. \n\n By default the parameters you set in the domain setting will be included in all Short URLs associated with that domain. \n\n You can always override the domain defaults for each URL by passing the appropriate variables when creating or updating a short URL \n\n ### Setting a Custom string for an Alias (short.fyi/alias) \n\n While creating a short URL you can specify which domain to use. You can choose to use your own branded domain or our default domain - Short.fyi. \n\n Each Alias is unique within a domain they are related to. This means that if multiple accounts use you the same domain (for example short.fyi), if an alias is already taken you may not create a new destination for it.\n\n That said - If you would like to use a specific alias which is already taken - the only way to do so is to create it on a new domain you own and have attached to your Shorten.rest account. \n\n ### Random Aliases \n\n By default - unless you specify a vanity URI for your alias each URL that is shortened on our platform will have a random string generated by the API. This means that if the &apos;alias&apos; attribute of a /aliases POST request is not provided, or is an empty string, a random string of seven characters will be generated and returned as part of the POST response. \n\n You can also place the @**rnd** macro within the alias field when you create a new alias, for example /vanity/@rnd, which might return an alias like /vanity/ZMAefRt, or /vanity@rnd, which might produce something like /vanityMRtvxadf. Only the first @rnd in an alias attribute will be replaced. \n\n ### NOTES \n\n ( * ) All methods of the Shorten.REST API require that your API key be provided in **x-api-key** header. \n\n (**) All API parameters are case sensitive",

We\ndo not accept queries sent from web browsers. Copy-paste the cURL commands\nand run them from your computer.\n\n**Cache** the data you get from the API if you are using it in web or mobile integration. It's not ok to query the API on *every* page request you serve. The [demo](https://spinitron.com/v2-api-demo/) shows how easy it can be to implement a file cache.\n\nAn extension to this API with access to all stations for partner applications is available.

      "description": "Welcome to the Svix API documentation!\n\nUseful links: [Homepage](https://www.svix.com) | [Support email](mailto:support+docs@svix.com) | [Blog](https://www.svix.com/blog/) | [Slack Community](https://www.svix.com/slack/)\n\n# Introduction\n\nThis is the reference documentation and schemas for the [Svix webhook service](https://www.svix.com) API. For tutorials and other documentation please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.svix.com).\n \n## Main concepts\n\nIn Svix you have four important entities you will be interacting with:\n\n- `messages`: these are the webhooks being sent. They can have contents and a few other properties.\n- `application`: this is where `messages` are sent to. Usually you want to create one application for each user on your platform.\n - `endpoint`: endpoints are the URLs messages will be sent to. Each application can have multiple `endpoints` and each message sent to that application will be sent to all of them (unless they are not subscribed to the sent event type).\n - `event-type`: event types are identifiers denoting the type of the message being sent. Event types are primarily used to decide which events are sent to which endpoint.\n\n\n## Authentication\n\nGet your authentication token (`AUTH_TOKEN`) from the [Svix dashboard](https://dashboard.svix.com) and use it as part of the `Authorization` header as such: `Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}`. For more information on authentication, please refer to the [authentication token docs](https://docs.svix.com/api-keys).\n \n<SecurityDefinitions />\n\n\n## Code samples\n\nThe code samples assume you already have the respective libraries installed and you know how to use them. For the latest information on how to do that, please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.svix.com/).\n \n\n## Idempotency\n\nSvix supports [idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. This is useful when an API call is disrupted in transit and you do not receive a response.\n\nTo perform an idempotent request, pass the idempotency key in the `Idempotency-Key` header to the request. The idempotency key should be a unique value generated by the client. You can create the key in however way you like, though we suggest using UUID v4, or any other string with enough entropy to avoid collisions.\n\nSvix's idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key for any successful request. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result for a period of up to 12 hours.\n\nPlease note that idempotency is only supported for `POST` requests.\n\n\n## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\n\nThis API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). And that allows cross-domain communication from the browser. All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.\n",

      "description": "# Overview\nThe Fitbit Plus API is a RESTful API. The requests and responses are formated according to the\n[JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/) specification.\n\nIn addition to this documentation, we also provide an\n[OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) \"yaml\" file describing the API:\n[Fitbit Plus API Specification](swagger.yaml).\n\n# Authentication\nAuthentication for the Fitbit Plus API is based on the\n[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). Fitbit Plus currently supports grant\ntypes of **client_credentials** and **refresh_token**.\n\nSee [POST /oauth/token](#operation/createToken) for details on the request and response formats.\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Building Integrations\nWe will provide customers with unique client credentials for each application/integration they build, allowing us\nto enforce appropriate access controls and monitor API usage.\nThe client credentials will be scoped to the organization, and allow full access to all patients and related data\nwithin that organization.\n\nThese credentials are appropriate for creating an integration that does one of the following:\n - background reporting/analysis\n - synchronizing data with another system (such as an EMR)\n\nThe API credentials and oauth flows we currently support are **not** well suited for creating a user-facing\napplication that allows a user (patient, coach, or admin) to login and have access to data which is appropriate to\nthat specific user. It is possible to build such an application, but it is not possible to use Fitbit Plus as a\nfederated identity provider. You would need to have a separate means of verifying a user's identity. We do not\ncurrently support the required password-based oauth flow to make this possible.\n\n# Paging\nThe Fitbit Plus API supports two different pagination strategies for GET collection endpoints.\n\n#### Skip-based paging\n\nSkip-based paging uses the query parameters `page[size]` and `page[number]` to specify the max number of resources returned and the page number. We default to skip-based paging if there are no page parameters. The response will include a `links` object containing links to the first, last, prev, and next pages of data.\n\nIf the contents of the collection change while you are iterating through the collection, you will see duplicate or missing documents. For example, if you are iterating through the `calender_event` resource via `GET /pub/calendar_event?sort=start_at&page[size]=50&page[number]=1`, and a new `calendar_event` is created that has a `start_at` value before the first `calendar_event`, when you fetch the next page at `GET /pub/calendar_event?sort=start_at&page[size]=50&page[number]=2`, the first entry in the second response will be a duplicate of the last entry in the first response.\n\n#### Cursor-based paging\nCursor-based paging uses the query parameters `page[limit]` and `page[after]` to specify the max number of entries returned and identify where to begin the next page. Add `page[limit]` to the parameters to use cursor-based paging. The response will include a `links` object containing a link to the next page of data, if the next page exists.\n\nCursor-based paging is not subject to duplication if new resources are added to the collection. For example, if you are iterating through the `calender_event` resource via `GET /pub/calendar_event?sort=start_at&page[limit]=50`, and a new `calendar_event` is created that has a `start_at` value before the first `calendar_event`, you will not see a duplicate entry when you fetch the next page at `GET /pub/calendar_event?sort=start_at&page[limit]=50&page[after]=<cursor>`.\n\nWe encourage the use of cursor-based paging for performance reasons.\n\nIn either form of paging, you can determine whether any resources were missed by comparing the number of fetched resources against `meta.count`. Set `page[size]` or `page[limit]` to 0 to get only the count.\n\nIt is not valid to mix the two strategies.\n",

      "description": "The Benefits Intake API enables authorized third-party systems, such as those used by Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs), agencies, and Veterans, to digitally submit documents for VA benefits claims directly to the claims intake process of the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). This API handles documents related to the following benefit claim types:\n* Compensation\n* Pension/Survivors Benefits\n* Education\n* Fiduciary\n* Insurance\n* Veteran Readiness & Employment (VRE)\n* Board of Veteran Appeals (BVA)\n\nAdditionally, the API offers real-time status updates on document submissions until they've been successfully accepted by VBA or another VA system for claims processing.\n\n**Important**: This API **may not** be used for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) benefits forms, including the Instructions and Enrollment Application for Health Benefits form (10-10EZ) and the application for CHAMPVA benefits form (10-10d).\n\n## Technical overview\n The Benefits Intake API first provides an upload location and unique submission identifier, and then accepts a payload consisting of a PDF document, other optional PDF attachments, and JSON metadata. The metadata describes the PDF attachments and identifies the Veteran who the benefits are related to.\n\n### Authentication and Authorization\nAPI requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name `apikey`. [Get access to sandbox](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/benefits-intake/sandbox-access).\n \n### Test data\nSince the primary purpose of this API is to accept user submissions, it doesn't have mock test data available. In the sandbox environment, data submitted to the API is not sent downstream. This API can return data that has been previously submitted by a consumer.\n\n### Document Submission Statuses\n\nAfter a successful upload, a submission status can be tracked using the GET /uploads/{id} endpoint. If multiple uploads have been made, the POST /uploads/report endpoint can be used to track the status of multiple submissions. For more information, please see steps 5 and 6 in the **How to Upload** section of this documentation or check out the example curl and response sections for these endpoints.\n\nDetailed descriptions of what each status means are found in this table.\n| Status        | What it means |\n| ---           |     ---     |\n| **Pending**   | - This is the initial status. Indicates no document submission has been uploaded yet.<br /><br />- Date of Receipt is not yet established with this status. |\n| **Uploaded**  | - Indicates document submission has been successfully uploaded (PUT) to the API server.<br /><br />- Submission has not yet been validated.<br /><br />- Date of Receipt is not yet established with this status.<br /><br />- Any errors with the document submission, such as having an unreadable PDF, may cause an Error status. |\n| **Received**  | - Indicates document submission has been received downstream of the API and is awaiting processing.<br /><br />- The VA Date of Receipt is set when this status is achieved.<br /><br />- Any errors with the document submission, such as having an unreadable PDF, may cause an Error status.<br /><br />- This is the final status in the sandbox environment unless further progress is simulated by the user. |\n| **Processing**| - Indicates the document package is being validated, processed, and made ready to route and work.<br /><br />- Any errors with the document submission, such as having an unreadable PDF, may cause an Error status.|\n | **Success**   | - Indicates the document submission has been successfully received within VA's mail handling system.<br /><br />- Success is the final status for a small percentage of submissions with claim types, Veteran types, or exception processes that are not worked in VBMS. A true value in the final_status attribute will indicate this.<br /><br />- Most submissions reach a Success status within 1 business day.<br /><br />- A small portion will take longer. However, some submissions may take up to 2 weeks to reach a Success status.|\n| **VBMS**      | - Indicates the document submission was successfully uploaded into a Veteran's eFolder within VBMS.<br /><br />- On average, submissions reach VBMS status within 3 business days. However, processing times vary and some submissions may remain in a Success status for several weeks before reaching a VBMS status.<br /><br />- Some document packages are worked in VA systems other than VBMS. For these submissions, Success is the final status. |\n| **Error**     | - Indicates that there was an error. Refer to the error code and detail for further information. |\n| **Expired**   | - After a POST request, there is a 15-minute window during which documents must be uploaded via a PUT request.<br /><br />- An Expired status means the documents were not successfully uploaded within this 15-minute window.<br /><br />- We recommend coding to retry unsuccessful uploads within 15 minutes using the same submission in case of connection issues. |\n\nIn the sandbox environment:\n* The final status of a submission is `received` since submissions do not actually progress to the Central Mail repository or VBMS.\n* Progress beyond the `received` status can be simulated for testing. A `Status-Override` header can be passed on the `/uploads/{id}` endpoint to change the status of a submission to simulate the various status scenarios.\n \nIn the production environment:\n* The date that the Benefits Intake API submits the documents downstream (indicated by the `received` status)  is used as the official VA date of receipt. This is usually the same day as when the documents are submitted by users, but not always.\n* If the document's final destination is VBMS, it can fall into an `error` state until the status of VBMS is returned.\n * If the document's final destination is another VA system besides VBMS, it can fall into an `error` state until the status of `success` is returned.\n\n\n### How to avoid submission errors\nThe Benefits Intake API returns three different categories of errors:\n* HTTP errors relating to the client request. These errors will be immediate.\n* Metadata and PDF validation errors run by the system before passing the submission downstream to subsequent services. These errors will be asynchronous but generally come within minutes of submission.\n* Downstream errors returned by subsequent services, usually relating to the content of the PDFs or metadata. These errors will be asynchronous and can take minutes to hours or longer to receive.\n\nTo prevent submission delays and errors:\n* Ensure that submitted PDFs are not locked by user passwords and that they are within the file and page size limits before submitting your payload.\n* Be sure to validate all metadata fields against their data requirements as defined in the DocumentUploadMetadata schema before submitting your payload.\n* The businessLine field is optional, but when included, it will ensure the fastest possible processing. If not specified, businessLine will default to CMP, the business line for Compensation requests.\n * The POST /uploads/validate_document endpoint can be used to ensure individual PDF documents meet system requirements prior to submission.\n\nFor information on how to monitor the status of submissions, please see Steps 5 and 6 of the **How to Upload** section of this documentation.\n\n### Attachment & file size limits\n There is no limit on the number of files a payload can contain, but file size and page dimension limits do apply.\n* Uploaded PDFs can't be larger than 78\" x 101\".\n* Uploaded PDFs can't exceed 100 MB.\n* The entire payload can't exceed 5 GB.\n\n### How to Upload\nThe Upload operation lets a client upload a multi-part document submission, specifically PDFs and metadata. Uploading is detailed below.\n 1. Client Request: POST https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/vba_documents/v1/\n    * No request body or parameters required.\n2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the following attributes:\n    * `guid`: An identifier used for subsequent status requests.\n    * `location`: A URL to which the actual document submission payload can be submitted in the next step. The URL is specific to this upload request, and should not be re-used for subsequent uploads. The URL is valid for 15 minutes (900 seconds) from the time of this response. If the location is not used within 15 minutes, the GUID will expire. Once expired, status checks on the GUID will return a status of `expired`.\n        * **Note**: If the status hasn't changed to uploaded within 15 minutes of submission, retry the POST request in step 1 to generate a new location URL.\n3. Client Request: PUT to the location URL returned in step 2.\n    * The request body should use the binary multipart/form-data format . The body can optionally be encoded as Base64.\n    * No `apikey` authorization header is required for this request, as authorization is embedded in the signed location URL.\n4. Service Response: The HTTP status indicates whether the upload was submitted.\n    * Additionally, the response includes an ETag header containing an MD5 hash of the submitted payload. This can be compared to the submitted payload to ensure data integrity of the upload.\n    * **Note**: A successful document submission **_does not_** mean it was successfully received by VA. Successful document submissions can fail later, as discussed above in the \"How to avoid submission errors\" section.\n5. Client Request: GET https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/vba_documents/v2/uploads/{id}\n    * `id`: An identifier (`guid`) returned in step 2 by the previous submission.\n 6. Service Response: A JSON API object with the following attributes:\n    * `guid`: The identifier of the submission for which a status was requested.\n    * `status`: The current status of the submission. See the previous \"Document Submission Statuses\" section for more information about the specific statuses.\n    * `code`: Only present if `status` is `error`. An error code specifying why the submission is in an error state. For a list of the error codes, see the schema for the GET /uploads/{id} 200 response.\n    * `detail`: Only present if `status` is `error`. Plain language detailing of the error corresponding to the error code and the specific submission.\n    * `final_status`: Indicates whether the status of the submission is final. Submissions with a `final_status` of `true` will no longer update to a new status.\n    * `updated_at`: The last time the submission status was updated.\n\n\nIf submissions to the API are made frequently, the bulk status endpoint should be used in place of the above Step 5 to request updates for multiple submissions:\n \n5. Client Request: POST https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/vba_documents/v1/uploads/report\n    * `ids`: A list of identifiers ( guid) returned in step 2 by the previous submissions.\n6. Service Response: A JSON API object with the following attributes for each `id`:\n    * `guid`: The identifier of the submission for which a status was requested.\n    * `status`: The current status of the submission. See the previous \"Document Submission Statuses\" section for more information about the specific statuses.\n    * `code`: Only present if `status` is `error`. An error code specifying why the submission is in an error state. For a list of the error codes, see the schema for the GET /uploads/{id} 200 response.\n    * `detail`: Only present if `status` is `error`. Plain language detailing of the error corresponding to the error code and the specific submission.\n    * `final_status`: Indicates whether the status of the submission is final. Submissions with a `final_status` of `true` will no longer update to a new status.\n    * `updated_at`: The last time the submission status was updated.\n    * Due to current system limitations, data for the /uploads/report endpoint is cached for one hour. The /uploads/{id} endpoint isn't cached.\n\n\n### Optional Base64 encoding\nBase64 is an encoding scheme that converts binary data into text format, so that encoded textual data can be easily transported over networks uncorrupted and without data loss.\n\n Base64 can be used to encode binary multipart/form-data in its entirety. Note that the whole payload must be encoded, not individual parts/attachments.\n\n After encoding the payload, the base64 string must be prefaced with `data:multipart/form-data;base64` in order to allow the system to distinguish the file type.\n\nThe final string payload will look something like this: `data:multipart/form-data;base64,(encryption string)==`, and close with the standard == marker. Note that the multipart boundaries, that is,\\\n-----WebKitFormBoundaryVfOwzCyvug0JmWYo and ending in\\\n------WebKitFormBoundaryVfOwzCyvug0JmWYo- must also be included.\n",

      "description": "The Deprecated Veteran Confirmation API allows you to confirm Veteran status for a given person. This can be useful for offering Veterans discounts or other benefits.\n\nThe API will only return \"Confirmed\" or \"Not Confirmed\".\n\n## Quickstart Guide\n### 1. Get Access Credentials\nGet started by filling out the form on the [Apply for VA Lighthouse Developer Access](https://developer.va.gov/apply) page.\n\nAfter submitting a request, you will receive your credentials for using the API in the Development environment, which allows you to try it out with mock data before moving to the Production environment.\n\n### 2. Test the API\nIn the endpoint documentation below, we've provided a curl command builder for trying out the API before implementation with your app.\nUse [Test User](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/blob/master/test_accounts/confirmation_test_accounts.md) attributes to populate the request body.\n\n### 3. Build your app\nThe base URI for the Veteran Confirmation API in the Sandbox environment is:\n\nhttps://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/veteran_confirmation/v0\n \nIn this environment, use attributes from the list of [Test Users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/blob/master/test_accounts/confirmation_test_accounts.md). Only Test Users can return a `\"confirmed\"` response.\n\nCheck out some of our [sample apps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients). Please visit our VA Lighthouse [Support portal](https://developer.va.gov/support) should you need further assistance.\n\n### 4. Show us a quick demo and get access to the Production environment\nAfter building your app, we ask that you give us a quick demo before we set you up with production credentials. Please see the [Path to Production](https://developer.va.gov/go-live) page for more details.\n \n## Authentication and Authorization\nThis API requires an API key in combination with identifiable information for the person being confirmed listed below. API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token provided in an HTTP header with name `apikey`. Including more information has a better chance of making a match and returning a Confirmed status.\n### Required information:\n* First Name\n * Last Name\n* Date of Birth\n* Social Security Number\n\n### Optional information:\n * Middle Name\n* Gender\n\n## Reference\n### Sandbox vs. Production Data\nAPIs accessed via the Sandbox environment are using the same underlying logic as VA's production APIs; only the underlying data store is different.\n\n### Master Veteran Index (MVI)\nThe Master Veteran Index confirms a user's identity. In Production, several factors are considered to confirm identity. These include: a user's first name, last name, date of birth and Social Security number. The MVI is mocked in the Sandbox environment. In this environment, the only factor used to confirm identity is the Social Security number.\n\n### Rate Limiting\nWe implemented basic rate limiting of 60 requests per minute. If you exceed this quota, your request will return a 429 status code. You may petition for increased rate limits by emailing and requests will be decided on a case by case basis.\n\n",

The forms information listed on VA.gov matches the information returned by this API.\n- Search by form number, keyword, or title\n- Get a link to the form in PDF format\n- Get detailed form metadata including the number of pages, related forms, benefit categories, language, and more\n- Retrieve the latest date of PDF changes and the SHA256 checksum\n- Identify when a form is deleted by the VA\n\n## Technical summary\nThe VA Forms API collects form data from the official VA Form Repository on a nightly basis.  The Index endpoint can return all available forms or, if an optional query parameter is passed, will return only forms that may relate to the query value. When a valid form name is passed to the Show endpoint, it will return a single form with additional metadata and full revision history. A JSON response is given with the PDF link (if published) and the corresponding form metadata.\n\n### Authentication and authorization\nThe form information shared by this API is publicly available.  API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name apikey. [Get a sandbox API Key](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/va-forms/sandbox-access).\n \n### Testing in sandbox environment\nForm data in the sandbox environment is for testing your API only, and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. This API also has a reduced API rate limit. When you're ready to move to production, be sure to [request a production API key.](https://developer.va.gov/go-live)\n\n### SHA256 revision history\nEach form is checked nightly for recent file changes. A corresponding SHA256 checksum is calculated, which provides a record of when the PDF changed and the SHA256 hash that was calculated. This allows end users to know that they have the most recent version and can verify the integrity of a previously downloaded PDF.\n\n### Valid PDF link\nAdditionally, during the nightly refresh process, the link to the form PDF is verified and the `valid_pdf` metadata is updated accordingly. If marked `true`, the link is valid and is a current form. If marked `false`, the link is either broken or the form has been removed.\n\n### Deleted forms\n If the `deleted_at` metadata is set, that means the VA has removed this form from the repository and it is no longer to be used.\n",

      "name": "Velo Payments APIs",
      "description": "## Terms and Definitions\n\nThroughout this document and the Velo platform the following terms are used:\n\n* **Payor.** An entity (typically a corporation) which wishes to pay funds to one or more payees via a payout.\n* **Payee.** The recipient of funds paid out by a payor.\n* **Payment.** A single transfer of funds from a payor to a payee.\n* **Payout.** A batch of Payments, typically used by a payor to logically group payments (e.g. by business day). Technically there need be no relationship between the payments in a payout - a single payout can contain payments to multiple payees and/or multiple payments to a single payee.\n* **Sandbox.** An integration environment provided by Velo Payments which offers a similar API experience to the production environment, but all funding and payment events are simulated, along with many other services such as OFAC sanctions list checking.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Velo Payments API allows a payor to perform a number of operations. The following is a list of the main capabilities in a natural order of execution:\n\n* Authenticate with the Velo platform\n* Maintain a collection of payees\n* Query the payor’s current balance of funds within the platform and perform additional funding\n* Issue payments to payees\n* Query the platform for a history of those payments\n\nThis document describes the main concepts and APIs required to get up and running with the Velo Payments platform. It is not an exhaustive API reference. For that, please see the separate Velo Payments API Reference.\n\n## API Considerations\n\nThe Velo Payments API is REST based and uses the JSON format for requests and responses.\n\nMost calls are secured using OAuth 2 security and require a valid authentication access token for successful operation. See the Authentication section for details.\n\nWhere a dynamic value is required in the examples below, the {token} format is used, suggesting that the caller needs to supply the appropriate value of the token in question (without including the { or } characters).\n\nWhere curl examples are given, the –d @filename.json approach is used, indicating that the request body should be placed into a file named filename.json in the current directory. Each of the curl examples in this document should be considered a single line on the command-line, regardless of how they appear in print.\n\n## Authenticating with the Velo Platform\n\nOnce Velo backoffice staff have added your organization as a payor within the Velo platform sandbox, they will create you a payor Id, an API key and an API secret and share these with you in a secure manner.\n\nYou will need to use these values to authenticate with the Velo platform in order to gain access to the APIs. The steps to take are explained in the following:\n\ncreate a string comprising the API key (e.g. 44a9537d-d55d-4b47-8082-14061c2bcdd8) and API secret (e.g. c396b26b-137a-44fd-87f5-34631f8fd529) with a colon between them. E.g. 44a9537d-d55d-4b47-8082-14061c2bcdd8:c396b26b-137a-44fd-87f5-34631f8fd529\n\nbase64 encode this string. E.g.: NDRhOTUzN2QtZDU1ZC00YjQ3LTgwODItMTQwNjFjMmJjZGQ4OmMzOTZiMjZiLTEzN2EtNDRmZC04N2Y1LTM0NjMxZjhmZDUyOQ==\n\ncreate an HTTP **Authorization** header with the value set to e.g. Basic NDRhOTUzN2QtZDU1ZC00YjQ3LTgwODItMTQwNjFjMmJjZGQ4OmMzOTZiMjZiLTEzN2EtNDRmZC04N2Y1LTM0NjMxZjhmZDUyOQ==\n\nperform the Velo authentication REST call using the HTTP header created above e.g. via curl:\n\n```\n  curl -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Basic NDRhOTUzN2QtZDU1ZC00YjQ3LTgwODItMTQwNjFjMmJjZGQ4OmMzOTZiMjZiLTEzN2EtNDRmZC04N2Y1LTM0NjMxZjhmZDUyOQ==\" \\\n  'https://api.sandbox.velopayments.com/v1/authenticate?grant_type=client_credentials'\n```\n\nIf successful, this call will result in a **200** HTTP status code and a response body such as:\n\n```\n  {\n    \"access_token\":\"19f6bafd-93fd-4747-b229-00507bbc991f\",\n    \"token_type\":\"bearer\",\n    \"expires_in\":1799,\n    \"scope\":\"...\"\n  }\n```\n## API access following authentication\nFollowing successful authentication, the value of the access_token field in the response (indicated in green above) should then be presented with all subsequent API calls to allow the Velo platform to validate that the caller is authenticated.\n\nThis is achieved by setting the HTTP Authorization header with the value set to e.g. Bearer 19f6bafd-93fd-4747-b229-00507bbc991f such as the curl example below:\n\n```\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer 19f6bafd-93fd-4747-b229-00507bbc991f \"\n```\n\nIf you make other Velo API calls which require authorization but the Authorization header is missing or invalid then you will get a **401** HTTP status response.\n\n\n## Http Status Codes\nFollowing is a list of Http Status codes that could be returned by the platform\n\n    | Status Code            | Description                                                                          |\n    | -----------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | 200 OK                 | The request was successfully processed and usually returns a json response           |\n    | 201 Created            | A resource was created and a Location header is returned linking to the new resource |\n    | 202 Accepted           | The request has been accepted for processing                                         |\n    | 204 No Content         | The request has been processed and there is no response (usually deletes and updates)|\n    | 400 Bad Request        | The request is invalid and should be fixed before retrying                           |\n    | 401 Unauthorized       | Authentication has failed, usually means the token has expired                       |\n    | 403 Forbidden          | The user does not have permissions for the request                                   |\n    | 404 Not Found          | The resource was not found                                                           |\n    | 409 Conflict           | The resource already exists and there is a conflict                                  |\n    | 429 Too Many Requests  | The user has submitted too many requests in a given amount of time                   |\n    | 5xx Server Error       | Platform internal error (should rarely happen)                                       |\n",

      "description": ">ℹ️ Master Data v2 is not compatible with data entities from previous versions, such as CL and AD.\r\n\r\n[Master Data](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/master-data-introduction) is a secure, fast, scalable, and extensible solution that allows users to create their own entities, store data, and retrieve information directly from the storefront or external integrations.\r\n\r\nSeveral internal VTEX modules use Master Data as a data repository, including Orders and Sales App. \r\n\r\nThere are two main ways to use Master Data:\r\n\r\n- [Directly from the storefront](#directly-from-the-storefront)\r \n- [With an external integration](#external-integrations)\r\n\r\n## Directly from the storefront\r\n\r\nWhen using Master Data within the storefront, consider the following:\r\n\r\n- Use the storefront host to query or store information to avoid issues related to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\r\n- Use the relative path to avoid CORS issues.\r\n- Configure the JSON Schema of the Data Entity to specify which information should be public and which should not be.\r \n- Avoid creating query loops to prevent potential throttling issues or APIs being disabled due to security protection measures.\r\n- Never add authentication keys, such as `X-VTEX-API-AppKey` or `X-VTEX-API-AppToken`, via JavaScript as this could pose security risks.\r\n\r\n## External integrations\r\n\r\nWhen using Master Data to store data from an external integration, such as client data from another service, consider the following:\r\n\r\n- Use the host `{{accountName}}.vtexcommercestable.com.br`.\r \n- Use the authentication keys (`X-VTEX-API-AppKey` ou `X-VTEX-API-AppToken`).\r \n\r\n## Common parameters\r\n\r\n| Name | Description |\r\n| -------- | -------- |\r\n| `accountName` | Account name in VTEX License Manager. |\r\n| `name` | Data Entity name. |\r\n| `schema` | JSON

      "description": "Check the new [Pricing onboarding guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/pricing-overview). We created this guide to improve the onboarding experience for developers at VTEX. It assembles all documentation on our Developer Portal about Pricing and is organized by focusing on the developer's journey.\r\n\r\nPricing is the VTEX module responsible for the SKU's price list. In this module, we have the base price of each SKU, optional fixed prices by trade policy, and rules that can be applied to dynamically generate different final prices according to the purchase context and the trade policy. \r\n\r\nFind more information on how to use this module and its business logic at our [Pricing onboarding guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/pricing-overview).\r \n\r\n## Rate limits per route\r\nThe rate limits per route revolve around the following values:\r\n\r\n\r\n| Operation | Rate | Burst credits  |\r\n| - | - | - |\r\n| `GET` | No rate limits | No rate limits |\r\n| `POST` and `PUT` | 2000 per minute<br>33 per second | 500 |\r\n| `DELETE` | 1000 per minute<br>16 per second | 300 |\r\n\r\n### Burst credits\r\nIn case the account exceeds the limit frequency for a Rate Limiter (for instance, when one account makes 34 requests per second in any price insert/update route), we decrease from the Burst Credit count the exceeding (in this example, 1 Credit).\r\n\r\nIn the event of the Burst Credits reaching 0 (zero), the request is blocked with a Status 429 response.\r \n\r\nThe credits fill up over time when the route is not being used, at the same rate as the route's Rate Limiter. In our example, for each second not sending a PUT or POST request, we increase 40 Burst Credits to this Rate Limiter.\r\n\r \n### Response Headers for rate limits\r\nIn the response of any request to the Pricing API, there are headers indicating the current status of the Rate Limiting. This information may be useful to evaluate the ideal frequency to send requests to a route, and when to send a new request in the event of reaching a Rate Limit.\r \n\r\n- `Ratelimit-Limit`: Total Burst Credits offered to a route\r\n- `Ratelimit-Remaining`: How many Burst Credits are still available to use\r\n- `Ratelimit-Reset`: How long (in seconds) it will take for Burst Credits to fill up completely (it will fill up to the *Ratelimit-Limit*)\r\n- `Retry-After`: Indicates how many seconds you will need to wait until the Rate Limiter accepts a new request to this route again. If this header response exists, this means your current request has been rate-limited and has not been processed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Integrating with Pricing v2 considering rate limits\r\nWhen developing an integration, consider the requests/route/account limits specified in the [Rate Limits per route](#rate-limits-per-route) section, and avoid surpassing this frequency.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to be rate limited, please await the time in seconds specified in `Retry-After` before making another request to the service, and reduce the rate of requests per second that your integration is making.\r\n\r\n## Index\r\n\r\n### Prices and Fixed Prices\r\n- `GET` [Get Price](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/prices/-itemId-)\r \n- `DELETE` [Delete Price](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#delete-/pricing/prices/-itemId-)\r \n- `PUT` [Create or Update Base Price or Fixed Prices](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#put-/pricing/prices/-itemId-)\r \n- `PATCH` [Create or Update Base Price or Fixed Prices](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#patch-/pricing/prices/-itemId-)\r \n-`GET` [Get Fixed Prices](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/prices/-itemId-/fixed)\r \n- `POST` [Create or Update Fixed Prices on a price table or trade policy](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#post-/pricing/prices/-itemId-/fixed/-priceTableId-)\r \n- `GET` [Get Fixed Prices on a price table policy](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/prices/-itemId-/fixed/-priceTableId-)\r \n- `DELETE` [Delete Fixed Prices on a price table or trade policy](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#delete-/pricing/prices/-itemId-/fixed/-priceTableId-)\r \n- `GET` [GET Computed Price by price table or trade policy](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/prices/-itemId-/computed/-priceTableId-)\r \n\r\n\r\n### Pricing Configuration\r\n- `GET` [Get Pricing Configuration](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/config)\r \n- `GET` [Get Pricing v2 Status](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/migration)\r \n\r\n\r\n### Price Tables\r\n- `GET` [Get rules for a price table](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/pipeline/catalog/-priceTableId-)\r \n- `PUT` [Update rules for a price table](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#put-/pricing/pipeline/catalog/-priceTableId-)\r \n- `GET` [Get all price tables and their rules](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/pipeline/catalog)\r \n- `GET` [List price tables](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api/#get-/pricing/tables)\r \n\r\n## Common parameters in the documentation\r\n\r\n| Parameter name | Description |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| `{{accountName}}` | Store account name. |\r\n| `{{environment}}` | The environment that will be called. |\r\n| `{{X-VTEX-API-AppKey}}`   | Located in the headers of the requests, user authentication key. |\r\n| `{{X-VTEX-API-AppToken}}` | Located in the headers of the requests, authentication password. |",
